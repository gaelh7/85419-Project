PAGE BEFORE THE BOOK STARTS
Hi!
This is a book of pictures and simple words. Each page explains how something
important or interesting works, using only the ten hundred words in our language that people use the most. This page is here to say hello and explain why
the book is like this.
I’ve spent a lot of my life worried that people will think I don’t know enough.
Sometimes, that worry has made me use big words when I don’t need to.
One thing that I’ve sometimes used big words for is the shape of the world.
The world is round, but it’s not exactly round. Because of how it spins, it’s a
little wider around the middle. If you’re building a space boat that’s going to
fly around the world, you have to be clear about what shape the world is, and
there are some big words that you can use instead of “round.” But most of the
time, it doesn’t matter exactly what the shape is, so people just say “round.”
When I was in school, I learned about space boats and learned to use lots of
big words for things like the shape of the world. Sometimes I would use those
big words because they were different from the small words in an important
way. But a lot of the time, I was really just worried that if I used the small words,
someone might think I didn’t know the big ones.
I liked writing this book because it made me let go of my fear of sounding stupid. After all—when you’re saying things like “space boats” and “water pushers,”
everything sounds stupid. Using simple words let me stop worrying so much. I
could just have fun making up new names for things and trying to explain cool
ideas in new ways.
Some people say that there’s no reason to learn big words in the first place—all
that matters is knowing what things do, not what they’re called. I don’t think
that’s always true. To really learn about things, you need help from other people, and if you want to understand those people, you need to know what they
mean by the words they use. You also need to know what things are called so
you can ask questions about them.
But there are lots of other books that explain what things are called. This book
explains what they do.
Okay, I’m done talking about the book now. Turn the page to learn about space!

SHARED SPACE HOUSE
The people in the house spend their time
working, playing, and taking pictures of
Earth. They do work for people on the
ground, helping to learn how things like
ﬂowers and machines work in space. Most of
the time, there are six people in the house,
with each person staying for half a year.

This building ﬂies through space just above
the air. People from different countries built
it and ﬂy up to visit it in space boats.
Because the house is falling around the
Earth, things inside it hang in the air instead
of dropping to the ﬂoor. Inside the house,
normal things like water act very strange,
and you can ﬂy around by kicking off the
walls. Everyone says it’s a lot of fun.

A big reason we built the space house was
so we could learn to keep people alive and
strong in space for months or years without
getting sick. We’ll need to be good at that if
we ever want to travel to other worlds.
To build the space house, we took each
piece up in a boat, pushed it until it went
really fast, then caught up to the house, and
stuck the part to the house.

PORCH
If you want to see what
something does when you
leave it out in space for a
while, you can put it here.

SPACE BOAT DOOR
(The flying space truck
grabbed on here.)

This room is from a
country named after the
rising sun. It’s the biggest
room in the house.

This room was built by a
group of countries with
many different languages
who work together a lot.

GRABBER ARM
This arm was built
in a country with
lots of snow. They
liked the arm so
much they put it
on their money.
People sleep in boxes in
the walls. There are four
of them in this room.

This room has a
beautiful view
of the Earth.

PEOPLE DOOR

before going through,
or you’ll die.)

This was the first room sent up.
People used to sleep there but
now they just keep stuff in it.

This room is where they
clean the space house’s
air and water. It’s loud.

these doors
for people to
use if there’s a
problem that
makes them
not want to be in space
anymore, but no one
will come get them.

These wings turn the Sun’s light
into the power that runs the
machines on the space house.

PART HOLDER
This part has no air in it. It
holds the wings and other
pieces of the house.

VISITING
SPACE BOAT

VISITORS
These space boats have flown up to the space house, bringing food, water, parts, and visitors.

FLYING SPACE TRUCK
BIG CARRIER FROM MANY
COUNTRIES
This carrier was built by a group of
countries working together. It flew
to the space house four times before
they stopped using it.

Most space boats are built to be
used only once, but these boats
flew to space and back many times.
We built five of them, and they did
a lot of the work of building the
space house.

BIG CARRIER
WITHOUT WINGS
This was built by a
country named after
the rising sun.

After over a hundred trips to space,
two of the trucks had blown up,
and we decided the three we had
left were too old to keep using.

PRETEND

STUFF CARRIER

BIRD
The other space boats here, even when
they were built by companies, were
owned by big countries or groups of
countries. These two, which are newer,
were built and flown by companies, and
countries pay them to carry stuff to the
space house.

PEOPLE CARRIER

This space boat is a people
carrier that they changed
so it flew itself. It carries
stuff instead of people, and
only goes up; it can’t land.

This is an old and simple space boat
that works very well. Once we stopped
using the truck with wings, it became
the only space boat that could carry
people to the space house.

TINY BAGS OF WATER YOU’RE MADE OF
Everything that’s alive is made of tiny bags
of water. Some living things are made of just
one bag of water. Those things are usually
too small to see. Other things are made of a
group of bags stuck together. Your body is a
group of lots and lots of these bags that are
working together to read this page.

These bags are full of smaller bags. Life uses
lots of bags. All life is made from different
kinds of water, and a bag keeps the stuff
inside it from touching the stuff on the outside. By using bags, living things can keep
different kinds of water in one place without
it all coming together.

LITTLE ANIMALS

OUTSIDE WALL

These are living things (not really “animals”) that got
stuck in our bags of water a long time ago, like the green
things in tree leaves. Now we can’t live without each
other. They get food and air from our bodies and turn
them into power for our bags.

The water bags that make up
animals have soft walls. The
bags in trees and flowers,
which don’t need to move
around as much as us, have a
less soft outside layer.

Some of the little bags you see here were
once living things on their own. Long ago,
some little green bags learned to get power
from the Sun. Then they got stuck inside
other bags, and those became ﬂowers and
trees. The green color of leaves comes from
the children of those little green bags.

GETTING IN AND OUT
Some things can go through the
bag’s wall on their own. Other things
can only go through if the bag helps
them, either by letting them through
an opening, or by making part of the
wall into a new bag to hold them.

SIZE
These bags are almost always too small
to see. In fact, they’re almost as small as
the waves of light we see with:

THINGS THAT MAKE YOU SICK

BLUE
GREEN
RED

These tiny things can get into your
bags and take control of them. When
they do that, they use the bag to build
more of them.

BAG FILLER

When the kind shown here gets into
you, your body gets hot, your legs
hurt, and you have to lie down. Your
whole body feels bad, and it makes
you hate everything. You feel like
you’re going to die but usually don’t.

This machine fills little bags with
stuff and then sends them out
into the water. Some stuff gets
sent out of the big bag to
another part of your body.

We say all life is made of bags, but
these things aren’t. They also can’t
make more of themselves; they have
to get a bag to make them. So we
don’t know if it makes sense to say
they’re “alive.” They’re more like an
idea that spreads itself.

The machine also fills
bags with death water,
marking them very
carefully before
sending them out
so they don’t
get used in the
wrong place.

EMPTY POCKETS
This part of the bag has
pockets to hold stuff that
it might need later. It also
makes a few things.
One of the things it makes
is that stuff that helps your
arms and legs get stronger.
Sometimes, people who want
to run or ride fast will put
bottles of that stuff into their
body and then lie about it.

INFORMATION
The information for how to make
different body parts is stored here.

READERS
These machines read the
information about how
to make parts and write
it on little notes, then
send them out through
the holes in the wall.

CONTROL AREA
This area in the middle holds
information about how to make
the different parts of your body. It
writes this information in notes and
sends them out into the bag.
Bags make more bags by breaking
in half. When this happens, the
control area also breaks in half, and
each half gets a full set of the bag’s
information.

MACHINE MAKER
This part makes the
little machines that sit
outside the control area.

CONTROL
AREA HOLES

Not all bags have these control
areas. The bags in human blood
don’t (which means blood can’t
grow) but the bags in bird blood do.

Notes and workers
go out through
these openings.

This control area may have once
been a living thing on its own, just
like the green things in leaves.

LITTLE BUILDERS

STRANGE BOXES
There are lots of these
little boxes in our water
bags. We don’t know
what they do.

BAGS OF DEATH WATER

BAG SHAPERS

These little bags are full of a kind of
water that breaks things into tiny
pieces. If something is put inside
them, the water breaks it down into
whatever it’s made of.

The space between bag
parts is full of lots of very
thin hair-like lines. These
are like bones for the bag;
they help hold its shape,
and do some other things.

If something goes wrong, these
little bags tear open and all their
bad water falls out. That makes the
whole bag around it fall to pieces
and die.
“Bags falling to pieces” sounds
bad, since bags are what you’re
made of. But if a bag was having
problems, it could hurt you. The
death water helps clear it away so
your body can make a new one.

Some of these shapers
also have holes down the
middle, and can carry
things from one part of
the bag to another.

This area is covered in little building machines that build new
parts for the bag. The builders sit just outside the control area,
reading the notes from inside that tell them what to build.
After the builder makes a part, the part falls away into the bag.
Each part has a job to do. Maybe its job is to tell another part it’s
time to stop working. Maybe its job is to turn one kind of part into
another. Maybe it makes another part do something different. Or
maybe it has a job, but waits until it sees another part before it
starts working.
The strange thing is, no one tells the part where to go. It just falls
out into the room with all the other parts, and hangs around until
it runs into whatever part it’s supposed to grab. (Or until another
part grabs it!) This sounds strange, and it is! There are so many
parts, and they’re all grabbing each other and stopping each other
and helping each other.
The insides of these bags are harder to understand than almost
anything else in the world.

HEAVY METAL POWER BUILDING
These buildings use special kinds of hard-toﬁnd heavy metal to make power.
Some of the metals they use can be found in
the ground, but only in a few places. Other
kinds can be made by people—but only with
the help of a power building that’s already
running.
These metals make heat all the time, even
when they’re just sitting. They make two
kinds of heat: normal heat—like heat from a
ﬁre—and a different, special kind of heat.
This special heat is like light that you can’t
see. (At least, you can’t see it most of the
time. If there’s a whole lot of it, enough to
kill you quickly, you can see it. It looks blue.)

Normal heat can burn you, but the special
heat from these metals can burn you in a
different way. If you spend too much time
near this heat, your body can start growing
wrong. Some of the ﬁrst people who tried to
learn about these metals died that way.
The special heat is made when tiny pieces
of the metal break down. This lets out a lot
of heat, far more than any normal ﬁre could.
But for many kinds of metal, it happens very
slowly. A piece of metal as old as the Earth
might be only half broken down by now.
Within the last hundred years, we learned
something very strange: When some of
these metals feel special heat, they break
down faster.

If you put a piece of this metal close to another piece, it will make heat, which will
make the other piece break down faster and
make more heat.
If you put too much of the metal together
like this, it gets hotter and hotter so fast that
it can all break down at once, letting out all
its heat in less than a second. This is how a
small machine can burn an entire city.
To make power, people try to put pieces of
this metal close enough together that they
make heat fast, but not so close that they go
out of control and blow up. This is very hard,
but there is so much heat and power stored
in this metal that some people have wanted
to try anyway.

POWER BUILDING
OUTSIDE POWER LINE
Even though the building
makes power, without outside
power it will stop running.
This is important, because it
means that if there’s a very
big problem, you can stop
things from the outside by
turning off the power.

This building holds the metal and
makes power. Water comes in, and it
uses the metal to heat the water, then
makes power from the hot water.

COOLING BUILDING
After they’re done with it, the sea water is very hot.
They put it in this building to let it cool down a little
so it’s not too hot when they put it back in the sea.

(There’s a bigger picture of it below.)

HOT METAL SIDE

They pour the water out into the air, where it
falls like rain. As it falls, the air cools it down. This
warms up the air, which makes it rise, and new cold
air moves in from the outside to take its place.

POWER SIDE

Used water comes out here.
The used water is clean, but it’s
still warm. Animals like to hang
around here when it’s cold out.

POWER LINE BOX

MAKING POWER WITH WATER

Sometimes animals get in
here and break something,
and it makes the entire
building stop working.

The building makes power by heating water. This means they need lots of cold
water, which is why they’re usually built near the sea or a big river.
They don’t let the water from the sea touch the water that goes near the hot metal
itself. Instead, they let the metal heat up water that runs through metal lines. Then
the heat from those lines heats water in another water carrier, which goes over to
the other part of the building. Then that water heats the water from the sea.

CONTROL STICKS
These sticks control how hot
the metal gets. When they’re
pushed down, the ends go in
between the pieces of metal
and block the special heat.
Sometimes, these are held
up by outside power, so
if the power stops, the
sticks all fall down and
stop the heat.

WALL

problems inside

Cold water gets pulled in
here. Sometimes fish get
stuck in it and they have
to turn off the power
building to figure out
what’s wrong.

to burn a hole through the floor. If that happens, this room is here so the
watery metal can fall down and then spread out over the floor.
It’s good if the metal can spread out, since when it’s all close together,
it keeps making itself hotter. If this room ever gets used, it means
everything has gone very, very wrong.

RED WORLD SPACE CAR
This is a space car that drives around on the
red world near Earth. Humans have never
been to the red world, but we’ve sent four
cars, along with lots of space ships ﬂying
around taking pictures from high above.
This car is the biggest one we’ve sent so
far—as big as a normal car on Earth.
The cars we’ve sent there are looking for
water, because if there’s water, there might
be life. Right now, there’s only a little water
there, and it’s so cold that it’s all hidden
away in the ground as snow. But it wasn’t
always that way!
By looking at the red world’s rocks, our
cars have learned something really cool:
A long time ago, when the red world was
young, it had seas.

We don’t think there’s life on the red world
today. We haven’t found any so far, and it’s
very cold and dry, with very thin air, so water can’t last long on the ground before it
turns to ice or air.
But if there used to be seas, then maybe
there used to be animals, too. On Earth,
when animals die, sometimes parts of their
bodies turn to a kind of stone. If there were
animals on the red world, maybe we can
ﬁnd the stones they left behind.
If we ﬁnd that there was life on the red
world, it will be one of the most important things we’ve ever learned—because if
there was life on the red world, it means
there’s probably life in lots of places.

We now know that most of the stars in
the sky have worlds around them, but we
don’t know if there’s life on those worlds.
We know there’s life on our own world, but
that doesn’t tell us whether life is normal
or not. Maybe life is a very strange thing
that got started only once, and none of the
other worlds have anyone on them to wonder about this question.
But if we learn that life started on the red
world, too, it means that life probably gets
started on new worlds all the time, and
probably also got started around many of
those other stars.
If our space car ﬁnds signs of life in the red
world’s stones, it means we are not alone.

LANDING THE SPACE CAR
Because this car was so heavy, it was hard for us to
make it slow down enough to land without breaking.
We could hang a big sheet behind it to slow it down,
but it’s so heavy—and the air there so thin—that the
sheet wouldn’t be able to slow it down enough.

HELPER BOX
Our space doctors came up with a very
strange idea. They built a flying helper
box that lowered the space car to the
ground carefully on a long line.

THROUGH THE DUST

FLY AWAY

The helper box hung the car on long lines
because the fire pushers holding up the
box had to be kept from the ground. If the
pushers were too low, the air coming out
of them would throw up clouds of dust
that would make the ground hard to see.

Once the car was safe on the ground,
the helper box’s job was done, so it flew
off and hit the ground somewhere else,
where it wouldn’t hurt the space car.

This sounded to most people like a strange idea
that probably wouldn’t work. But they looked at
every other idea anyone could think of, and all of
them seemed even less good.
And, in the end, it worked. The space car landed,
looked around, and started learning.

THIN BURNING LIGHT GUN
The car uses this gun to point a thin bright
light at rocks far away. The light is so
bright the rocks stop being rocks and turn
to air. Then the car uses an eye to look at
the air to learn what the rock was made of.

COLOR EYES
These are the best
eyes on the car.

If the car found life, it could try to use this
gun to learn about it, but the life might not
be alive when it was done.

AIR FEELER

BOX OF HOT METAL

This part is here to feel
the air around the car to
learn whether it’s a nice
day or not. Some days are
warm, some days are cool,
and on some days the air
is full of sand.

This box holds a piece of a kind of heavy
metal that makes its own heat. The heat
powers the car. The metal is hard to find
and you need lots of money to get it.

When the car landed, part
of this got broken, so it
doesn’t work too well.

Now that we’re not building new cityburning machines as much, there’s less
of this metal lying around. That’s bad for
space cars, but probably good for the
rest of us.

SPACE TALKERS

It’s different from the kinds of metal they
use to blow up cities, but it’s made in the
same buildings as some of those metals.

The car uses these to tell
us about what it learns
and to find out what we
want it to do next.

THIS IS A BOX
FOR THE CAR TO
PUT THINGS IN
The box looks at the
things and tells the
car what it learned.

ARM
ROCK
TOUCHERS

EYE FOR
LOOKING DOWN

EYES FOR SEEING
ROCKS SO THE CAR
WON’T HIT THEM

While it’s coming down
from space, the car
uses this eye to look
down at the ground
to learn where all the
rocks are. That way,
once it’s on the ground,
it can drive around
without getting lost.

NAMES OF FRIENDS
WHEELS
The rocks on the red world are
very pointy, and these wheels
have a lot of holes in them. Next
time we will make them stronger.

When the car was being built,
the car builders gathered the
names of lots of people who like
space. They wrote all the names
in very small letters on little
rocks, and the car carried the
rocks to the red world.

LEARNING BOX
The car puts things
in here to learn more
about them.

EYE FOR
LOOKING
AT SMALL
STUFF

SPECIAL LIGHT FOR
SEEING WHAT ROCKS
ARE MADE OF
This part has a piece of
heavy metal inside it that
gives off special light. When
the space car puts it next to
a rock from the ground, the
light makes the rock from
the ground give off light
of its own. By looking at
that light, the space car can
figure out what the rock is
made of.

DUSTER

ROCK
GRABBER

HUMAN SICKNESS CHECKER
This part pays attention to special kinds of heat from space that could
make people sick. There’s a lot of this heat in space, but the Earth makes a
field that keeps us safe. The red world’s field isn’t as strong, so we want to
learn about this heat before we send people there.
The problem with this heat is that if you get too much of it, your body
starts growing wrong. If you get way too much of it, food comes out of
your mouth and you die.

BAGS OF STUFF INSIDE YOU
This is a map of some of the different bags
in your body and how they join together.
It doesn’t show what they’re really shaped
like or how they’re pushed together inside
your body.

There are lots of important parts of your
body that aren’t shown on this map. But
that’s okay; a body has too many parts to
show on any map.

In that way, it’s kind of like the colored
maps in cities that tell you where trains
go—it shows how the places are joined together, but not what they’re shaped like or
how far away from each other they are.

HOLE TO OUTSIDE
THIS IS WHAT YOU
THINK WITH.

This hole is in your nose. It helps you
breathe and lets you smell things.

When you read words (like
these), this part of your
body turns them into ideas.

This is the hole in your mouth. It’s where air goes in

stuck in here.
That’s one of the
biggest reasons
people’s bodies
stop working.

These make a kind of

BLOOD HALLWAYS

BLOOD
PUSHER

This bag breaks tiny things into even smaller, simpler
parts they’re made of. Your body uses it in many ways,
like to get rid of the stuff in wine that makes you feel
strange (which keeps you from feeling strange forever).
It also makes water for your hallways. If this bag has a
problem, your eyes turn yellow and your body stops
working.

BLOOD CLEANERS

This doesn’t
seem to do
anything.
Sometimes it has
a problem and
doctors have to

SMALL FOOD HALLWAY
This hallway is where a lot of food
gets broken down and the stuff
your body needs is taken out.

Most of the time, the water from
your blood cleaners is yellow, but
eating certain colorful foods can
make it change color for a while.
(If it turns dark or red, it may
mean you’re sick.)

The hallway is about as long as a
car. It makes a lot of turns so it can
fit in your stomach.

BIG FOOD HALLWAY
This hallway is wider than the
small hallway, but shorter. This
is where your body takes extra
water out of the food so you don’t
need to drink as much water.

Air bags

BODY PLAN HOLDERS
These parts hold lots of plans
for new people. Each plan is
made from pieces of the plans
used to make you.

These parts also control how
your voice, hair, and body grow.

There are a lot of living

DRYER
DUST CATCHER

WHY CLEANING IS HARD

When the air blows through
the clothes, it carries away
bits of dust and tiny pieces of
the clothes. This thing catches
the dust so it doesn’t gather
somewhere else in the house.

Line that turns
the clothes box

You can wash away some kinds of dirt using water,
because dirt sticks to water and gets carried away by it.
But other things that make clothes dirty, like some stuff
your skin makes, don’t stick to water.

DOOR

To get rid of stuff that doesn’t stick to water, we use
special cleaning stuff. When you put this stuff in with
your clothes, it sticks to the stuff that makes clothes
dirty, but it also sticks to the water around it. Then,
when you shake everything, the water pulls the dirt free.

Hot air
going out

When the catcher fills up, you
have to clean it out, because if
it’s full of dust, it blocks the air.
This keeps the machine from
drying—and the dust is
easy to burn, so it can
help a fire start.

This pushes the clothes against the side
of the cup, and it makes the water fall out
of the clothes and into holes in the cup
wall. Then the water falls to the bottom,
and the water mover pulls it out to get
rid of it.

to let water

Because the clothes cup spins so fast, it’s
hard to keep it from shaking, making loud
noises, or breaking.
To make the cup quieter and keep it from
breaking, they hang it on holders that
can stretch. This lets it move around a
little, which makes it quieter. (It’s just like
when someone calls you and your phone
shakes; it’s much louder if it’s sitting on a
hard table than if it’s on a soft bed.)
Letting the cup move around makes it
quieter, but if all the clothes end up on
one side of the cup, it can move around
too much. Then the machine starts
making a loud noise as it shakes. Most
machines can tell when this is happening
and turn themselves off; if they didn’t,
they could shake themselves to pieces.

EARTH’S SURFACE
These maps show the Earth’s surface. The
Earth’s surface is special, as far as we know.
It’s the only place where we’ve found seas
of water, and the only place where the land
is made of sheets of rock that move around.
There are a lot of interesting things here.
These maps show where some of them are.

Earth is a round ball, so to ﬁt its surface
on a page, it has to be stretched out. This
changes the shapes and sizes of some areas. On this map, it makes the land at the
top and the bottom look much bigger than
it really is, and some of the places near the
sides look stretched out.

PLACES WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF TREES

There’s no way around this problem. Every
paper map of a round world is wrong about
size, shape, or the direction from one place
to another. The shape chosen for this map
tries to keep all these things in mind, not
stretching any one part too much or making
any area look too wrong.

ICE SHEETS

LEFT-OVER POOLS

Since before the earliest humans (but still not
long ago, next to how old the Earth is), our world
has been going through very cold times and very
warm times. During the cold times, ice grows over
the land, and the seas fall hundreds of feet.

When the great sheets of ice turned to water, they
left behind deep pools full of water where pieces
of them pressed into the ground. Over the
next few hundred-hundred years—as
rivers grow and change—they will
find paths to the sea and
disappear.

WARMING

They stopped after a while because
the inside of the world turned out to
be too hot. The hole is still there, but
they put a cover over it.

SEA THAT WE DIDN’T
MEAN TO MAKE
Over a hundred years ago,
people cut some paths in the
land to bring water from a big
river to grow food. More water
came through than they wanted,
and they couldn’t stop it. Over
a year or so, the water made a
new sea.

CIRCLE POOL

These mountains formed
as a single line, when
these land areas were
joined together. Then a
new sea opened up in the
middle of the line and the
two halves were carried
away from each other.

Before the time of the great bird animals, hot rocks rose from
the ground here and covered the land. Fires burned, and smoke
poured out across the Earth. The rocks cooled in a great sheet
across the land and much of it is still there.
At the same time the hot rocks covered the land,
nearly all life died out. People who learn about
the past call this the Great Dying; more kinds
of life disappeared from Earth than at
any other time.
Most people think the fire, rocks,
and clouds of smoke were what
caused the Great Dying, but
we’re still figuring out how
it happened. It was so
long ago that many
of the rocks from
that time are
lost or hidden
deep in the
ground.

The land on top of this mountain

Earth than any other land. There
are other mountains that rise
higher above the sea’s surface,
but this one is farthest from the
center because the Earth is more
wide than tall.

Once, a man took over part of the
world. The world fought with him
and took that part back. They yelled
at him and made him go stay on a
little piece of land in the sea near
where he had lived.
He didn’t want to stay there, so he
came back in a boat, and the whole
thing happened again. After fighting
him a second time, the world sent
him to live on this far-away land
where he wouldn’t be able to get
back, and that finally worked.

ICE LAND
At the south end of the world, where it’s very cold, there’s a
lot of ice piled up on the land. This ice has been here for a long
time. As the world gets warmer, some of it is starting to turn to
water, which lots of people are worried about.

Note: This is not the area that people call “Ice Land.” There’s a land to the north

Land, with its green grass, is next to a much bigger place covered in thick ice
from one side to the other. That place with the ice is called Green Land.

Their boat had a problem and had to come back,
but didn’t have room to bring the machine down to
Earth with them. They decided to leave it in their empty
Moon boat, which was going to burn up in Earth’s air without
landing. The heavy metal was in a box that was strong enough that
it wouldn’t burn up, and they didn’t think it would break open, but just to
be safe—and to make sure no one found it and stole the metal—they pointed
the Moon boat toward this really deep part of the sea.

between some mountains
where it almost never rains or

are drier than anywhere else in
the world.

This is an area of hills and small mountains.
A few hundred-hundred years ago—long
before people lived here—the great ice
sheets turned to water, and the sea rose. At
the same time, the ground beneath the area
was moving down. After a time, the water
started covering the feet of the mountains.
As it moved in over the land, the sea filled
in the old river beds between the hills,
creating beautiful branching water-ways
that wind between the points of land still
above the water.

UNDER A CAR’S FRONT COVER

SMOKE BURNER
HOW COOLERS WORK

FIRE BOX

Some coolers work by just using water to carry away heat from
hot things. But some machines can use power to make things
colder than the air around them.

This fire box is the car’s pusher. Like sky boat
pushers, it makes power by burning fire water
using air from outside.

You need some cooling stuff. The best kind of cooling stuff is
something that’s air when it’s as warm as a room, but turns to
water when it gets cold. There are a few kinds of air that work
for this.

To get pushing power from the fire water, the car
burns it in little closed boxes. When the water
burns, it gets hot, which makes it get bigger and
push on the walls of the box. One of the walls of
the box can move, and it has a stick that joins it
to a wheel.

The cooling air starts off as warm as the air outside.
To start the cooling, first you push the air into a
smaller space. This makes it get hot (“Making air
smaller makes it hotter” is an important air law).
For some coolers, this turns them to water.

When the sides of the little boxes move, their
sticks push their wheels around. Those wheels are
all joined by a turning stick. That stick turns more
wheels, and those wheels turn the wheels that
touch the ground.

When cars burn fire water,
the smoke it makes has lots
of stuff in it that can make
people and animals sick. This
machine helps the smoke
finish burning so it turns to air
and water.
(The kind of air it turns into
isn’t good for the world,
either, but at least it’s better
than the kinds in the smoke.)

Next, you let the stuff cool down while holding it in
the smaller space. When it’s done cooling, it’s back
to being as warm as the air again, but it’s smaller.
Last, you let it get big again. (If it’s water now,
it will turn back to air.) Because of the air law,
this means it will get colder, just like making it
smaller made it hotter. You use the cold air to
cool things down. You keep doing this until it
warms back up, then send it back and do the
whole thing again.

If you stop too hard, your wheels
can stop turning and start to
slide. Once wheels start sliding,
they become less good at
stopping the car.
When the computer feels that
one of the wheels has started
sliding, this box lifts the stoppers
away from the wheel enough that
it grabs the ground and starts
turning again. Then it presses
the stopper back down. It can
do this many times each second.
This box makes cars much, much
better at stopping.

This line takes the
cleaner smoke and
h
sends it out through
a hole in the back off
the car.

LINES TO AIR

But there’s a lot of other stuff, too, and even
someone who knows a lot about cars can
have a hard time telling what every part is.

This picture shows some of the things you
might see if you open a car’s front cover.

NOTE:
Before opening the car to look under
the cover, you should stop driving.

FAST OR SLOW CONTROL LINE
When you push the go stick with your foot, this lets more
air into the fire box, which makes it run faster. How fast
the engine goes is controlled only by how much air you
let in; the computer decides how much fire water to add.

FIRE

CARRIER

The fire box that powers a car pulls in lots of air to burn,
which leaves nothing behind. Lines joined to it are also “full”
of nothing, and the car uses that nothing to pull on stuff.

FIRE STARTERS

STOPPER BOX

These use power to
make little flashes that

This box is joined to the wheels by carrier

down the lines. That water pushes the
stoppers against the wheels.

done burning.

SLIDING WATER
This water helps the parts
of the fire box spin without
getting stuck. If you run
out of it, your engine stops
turning, and sometimes the
parts get stuck together
and it can never turn again.

STOPPING WATER
The stoppers that press against the wheels
wear away over time, which means you
have to push them farther to get them to
touch the wheels. To push the stoppers
farther, the stopper box needs to push
more water down the line. This cup holds
water for it to use. If the water in here falls
too low, it might mean your stoppers are
almost worn away and you need new ones.

FIRE BOX COMPUTER

This water gets dirty, so
you have to change it

This computer watches how the
fire box is working, and decides
how much fire water to add to
the air it sends in.
The computer also decides at
exactly which point to turn on
the fire starters as the fire box’s
stick turns. If they turn on at the
wrong time, it can make the fire
box stop pushing as hard, make
loud noises, or break.

POWER BOX
This box holds power to

of power at once, so this
power box is built to let
out its power very fast.

TURNING LIGHTS
These tell other cars that
you’re about to turn. A few
moments before you turn,
you should pull the stick
that makes the lights flash.
Some people seem to have
a hard time with this idea.

You have to be careful,
because if you let the

is enough power to

metal to water.

POWER MAKER
This thing uses the
fire box’s spinning
stick to make
power. That
power is used to
keep the power box
full.

FRONT LIGHTS
These let you see the
road when it’s dark.

CIRCLE LINE

AIR CLEANER

This line goes around the fire
box’s turning stick, then goes
around a lot of other wheels in the
car that power different machines—
like the thing that makes power for the
power box. That way, the fire box can
turn them all while it’s also turning the
ground wheels.
Sometimes this breaks. When that
happens, your fire box can only turn
the ground wheels. Your car can keep
driving, but it won’t be able to cool
down, so you’ll only be able to drive
for a few minutes before the car gets
too hot and turns itself off.

SHARED LINE
This power line joins one end
of the power box right to the
metal of the car. All the other
parts that use power also touch
the metal of the car. That way,
power runs through them,
through the car, and back to
the power box.
All the parts need to make
sure they’re touching each
other through the body of
the car. If they don’t, power
could build up between
them, and that can make
it start running the
wrong way through
a part, which can
break things.

The fire box burns lots of
air very fast. If there’s
stuff in the air, it can hurt
the fire box. This box
cleans air before it gets
sent to the area where
fire water is burned.

There are two coolers here. The one in back cools the fire
box, and the one in front cools the cooling water for the
people in the car. (The people-cooler is in front because
you need colder air to cool people. A fire box is so hot
that warm and cold person-air are almost
the same to it.)

The stick from the fire box goes into a huge box full of wheels, and that box
turns the ground wheels. It’s there so the fire box can turn at the same
number of times each second no matter how fast or slow the car is
going. The wheel box is as big as the fire box and has lots of parts
inside, but most of it is hidden under the other parts here.

HITTER
If the car runs into
something, this
part hits it first.

SKY BOAT WITH TURNING WINGS
Normal sky boats have to go fast so the air
hits their wings hard enough to hold them
up. If they ﬂy too slow, they fall. (Sometimes
falling makes them go fast enough to ﬁx it!)

This boat works just like those sky boats, but
it uses a cool idea: Instead of the whole boat
going fast, only its wings go fast. The rest
of the boat can go as slowly as it wants—or
even stop and sit in one place in the sky.

If a normal sky boat had wings that went
faster than its body, the wings would ﬂy
away, but this boat’s wings go in a circle.
That keeps them near enough to hold on to
while still going around fast enough to ﬂy.

TURNING WINGS

POWER SPINNER

SPIN CHANGER

BOAT HANGER

These are a lot like
the wings on normal
sky boats, but they
go around instead of
forward.

This is a fire water machine
that works like a sky boat
pusher, but this kind of boat
uses all the spinner’s power
for turning the stick holding
the turning wings. Hot air
comes out, like in a sky boat
pusher, but it doesn’t push
on anything.

To work best, the power spinner needs to turn very
fast, but the wings can’t go around that fast. The
spin changer uses wheels with teeth to make the
wings turn more slowly than the power spinner.

The boat hangs under the wings, and
this piece of metal holds them together.

If the boat didn’t have this box, the wings would
turn the same number of times each second as the
power spinner, and the ends of the wings would
go a lot faster than sound. That would make them
stop working, and probably break off.

This is a machine for making small changes
to how the wings are turned as they swing
around, which changes how they push
on the air. (It’s a little confusing—you can
read more about how it works below.)

POINTING WINGS
These wings keep the
boat pointed straight.
(The pusher next to it
helps with that, too.)

These use water to push the wing
controls around (see below).

This line feels radio waves.

When the boat’s wings turn, it pushes the
boat in the other direction. This end blower
pushes back, keeping the boat from spinning.

LAND FEET
Some sky boats use these instead of
wheels, since they often land in places
like grass or dirt where wheels get stuck.

In a few countries, sky boat
wings turn right. Most turn left.

HOW THESE
SKY BOATS GO

BENDING WINGS

A sky boat’s wings can turn so that they’re
going straight into the wind, or so that the
wind is pushing them up. If they turn straight
into the wind, they don’t lift the sky boat.

Sometimes, sky boat
wings bend down
while they’re sitting on
the ground. This might
look like it would cause
some problems, but
it’s normal! Wings that
bend a little can be
easier to control, and
when they’re swinging
around, the force of
the swing stretches
them out straight.

To go forward, a sky boat controls its wings
so the one in the front goes straight into the
wind, and the one in the back turns so it gets
pushed up.

This makes the the sky boat lean forward. Before, the wings were just
pulling it up, but after it leans forward a little, they pull it a little forward,
too. The more it leans, the faster it goes forward. If it leans too far, the
wings will only pull it forward—not up. This causes bad problems.
The answer is that some people who
were very good at machines figured out
how to make a machine that turns the
wings up and down as they go around.

WAIT, HOW DOES THAT WORK?
You might wonder how a sky boat can
turn its front wing and not its back wing,
since the wings keep changing places.

Lifting a lot

Rings

To go forward, the driver uses a control to turn the bottom ring, which
turns the spinning top ring, too, so it’s higher on one side. When a wing is
on that side, its stick pushes its back edge up, so it goes straight into the
wind and doesn’t lift at all. When it goes around to the other side, its back
edge gets pulled down, making it lift a lot.

Normal
sky boat

A sky boat with turning wings needs
more air to push against than a
normal sky boat. Up high, where
normal sky boats fly, the air is thin
because it’s closer to space. Very
few turning-wing sky boats can fly to
the tops of the tallest mountains, but
normal sky boats can fly over them
with no problems.
Turning-wing sky boat

But a turning-wing sky
boat can still go farther
above the sea than most
under-water boats can go
below it.

If a normal sky boat stops working, it can keep going, slowly moving
down from slowing down too much. It turns out that even when it’s not
flying forward, a turning-wing sky boat can do the same thing!

Even though they’re thin, turning
wings can slow a falling boat
almost as much as a big sheet.

The edge of each wing has a stick on it, and these sticks run to a ring. This
ring spins with the wings and turning stick, and sits on top of another ring
that doesn’t spin.

HOW HIGH CAN
A SKY BOAT GO?

WHAT IF EVERYTHING BREAKS?

Not lifting

Turning
Not turning

Sticks

When your boat
can land straight
down, it helps to
be able to look
down.

When the engine stops, it lets go of the turning
stick so the wings can spin. If the wings are turned
in the right direction, the air going through them
will make them spin faster, and the air rushing
past pushes up on them, slowing the fall.
It may seem strange that turning the wings could
help push up on the boat when there’s no power
turning them. But you may have seen this kind
of free-turning lift happen without knowing it,
because trees use it.
Trees make babies by dropping tiny wooden tree
eggs on the ground. To help the trees spread farther, some trees
put small leaf wings on their eggs to slow their fall so the wind can
blow them. The wings aren’t very big, so they aren’t able to slow
the eggs much—but they turn. That lets them fall very slowly and
blow very far.
So don’t worry if your sky boat turns off. It can still fly, just like a
tiny spinning leaf, carrying you to the ground alive and safe.

Boat that goes
under the sea

THE US’S LAWS OF THE LAND
This country was started when a group of
people who were part of another country
decided to break away and start their own

People used
to take other
people from
far-away
countries,
bring them
across the
sea, and force
them to work
for their whole
lives without
getting paid.
There was a
part of the
law here that
said that when
you’re counting people,
you should
only count a
forced worker
as part of a
person. A while
after this was
written, we
fought a war
over whether
people should
be allowed
to own other
people like
that. The side
that said “yes”
lost, and we
crossed this
part out.

This part also
had some laws
about buying
and selling
people that we
changed after
the war.

You may
notice that
this doesn’t
actually say
whether the
Second Leader
becomes the
First Leader or
not. This made
things confusing later on.

No matter
how many
changes people make to
this system, it
will probably
never quite
work right.

country. They wrote down a small set of laws
to be the ground that the new country—and
its many future laws—would be built on.

BEFORE WE START
Hi; we’re the people in these little countries called “states,”
and we want to get together into a country. We want to make
everything nice and quiet, keep anyone from hurting us, and
make sure our kids will be free. That’s why we’re making a
country. Here are its laws:

BOOK ONE: The Law Makers
Part One: Laws are made by a group called Law Makers. There
are two rooms of Law Makers: the House and the Serious
Room.
Part Two: The people pick Law Makers to send to the House
for two years at a time. Bigger states get to have more
people in the House. Oh, and the country needs to count its
people sometimes so it can ﬁgure out how many chairs the
room needs.
Part Three: Every state sends two Law Makers to the Serious
Room for six years at a time. They can’t be too young.
Part Four: States make the laws about where and how people get together to pick leaders and decide what the country
should do.
Part Five: When the Law Makers get together, they should
write down what they talk about.
Part Six: Law Makers get paid. They can’t get in trouble for
what they say at work, but they also can’t do any other job for
the country while they’re Law Makers.
Part Seven: If the Law Makers have an idea for a new law, and
more than half the people in both rooms say they like it, they
send the idea to the country’s leader to be made into a law. If
the leader doesn’t like the idea, the Law Makers can still make
it a law, but it takes more of them.
Part Eight: Law Makers are allowed to take money from people, but only sometimes, and they can’t just take it all from one
person or anything like that. They’re allowed to use the money
to build certain kinds of things, like letter boxes and boats with
guns on them. They can get people in trouble for a few things,
like stealing boats (even if they do it far away) or making pretend money and telling people it’s real.
Part After Eight: There are lots of things the Law Makers aren’t
allowed to do. They can’t make up laws to lock someone up
for something they already did, or give some people special
names that mean they’re more important to the country than
others.
Part Ten: There are some things the country can do that the
states can’t, like creating money or starting wars. The states
also can’t take money from other states or put guns on boats.

BOOK TWO: The leaders
Part One: Every four years, the people in the country pick who
should lead them. They pick a First Leader, who is the head of
the country, and a Second Leader, who isn’t. If the First Leader
leaves or gets ﬁred, the Second Leader takes over the work the
First Leader was doing. The states get to choose the leaders
by a point system where each state gets one point for each
Law Maker it has.
Part Two: The leader controls the people who ﬁght for the
country. The leader can also can talk to the leaders of other
countries and get anyone out of trouble.
Part Three: Now and then, the First Leader should let the Law
Makers know how everything is going, and suggest some ideas.
Part Four: The Law Makers can ﬁre the First Leader, but only
for doing something really bad, like becoming leader of another country at the same time and having them attack us, or
stealing the country’s money and going to live on a boat.

BOOK THREE: The law deciders
Part One: There’s a group of people called the Top Law Deciders. They help decide whether laws have been broken. The
country can set up other groups of law deciders, too, but
they’re not as important as the Top Law Deciders.
Part Two: The Top Law Deciders only decide certain kinds of
law ﬁghts, like if the leaders of another country send someone here and they get in a ﬁght, or when someone has a law
ﬁght with a state. The rest of the time, they can only step into
certain law ﬁghts, and only when another decider has decided
something and the people in the law ﬁght don’t agree.
Part Three: “Turning against the country” can only mean a few
very clear things: ﬁghting us, joining a group that’s ﬁghting us,
or helping a group that’s ﬁghting us. To prove someone has
turned against the country, two people need to say they saw it,
or the person has to have admitted it in a deciding room. Law
Makers can make turning against the country against the law,
but they can’t use it as a reason to do whatever they want to
someone. (This had been a problem in some other countries.)

BOOK FOUR: The states
Part One: There are states, and they have to get along. When
the law deciders in one state decide something, the law deciders in other states don’t have to make that choice the same
way, but they can’t make it so the other choice doesn’t count.
That means that if someone gets in trouble in a state, they
can’t go to another state and get a law decider to tell them
they’re not really in trouble after all.

More than two hundred years later, those
laws, with some changes, are still being followed, learned about, and understood in
new ways.

Part Two: You have the same rights no matter what state
you’re from. Also, if you get in trouble in one state and run
away to another, the other state has to send you back to the
ﬁrst one.
Part Three: The country can add new states. The country can
also own areas of land inside states (to be used for things the
country needs) just like people do.
Part Four: The country promises that every state will be run
by its people, and that if someone attacks—or if they have a
problem and ask for help—the whole country will come and
ﬁght for them.

BOOK FIVE: Making changes
People can change these laws, but most of the Law Makers
and most of the states have to agree on the change. It can’t
just be a little more than half—it has to be most of them. If the
states want to make a change without the Law Makers, the
states can also hold a big law party where each state comes
and shares their ideas for changes, and then they decide which
ones they like.

BOOK SIX: Everyone, listen up
These laws are important and everyone has to follow them.
Also, if the country agrees on something with another country,
that’s important, too. Other laws are important, but less so.
Anyone working for the country has to promise that they’re
on our side (but they never have to say anything about God).

BOOK SEVEN: Does this all count yet?
This country only becomes real if more than eight states join.

TEN CHANGES:
Change One: The country can’t make laws about God. It also
can’t make laws about what people talk about, who they hang
out with, or what they write about, and can’t stop them from
telling the leaders if they’re angry about something, as long as
they’re not starting ﬁghts.
Change Two: Since having well-trained normal people with
guns is important for keeping the country safe, no stopping
people from having guns.
Change Three: Just because someone’s ﬁghting for the
country doesn’t mean you have to let them stay in your house.
Change Four: The police can’t go through your stuff without a
good reason and a special pass from a law decider.
Change Five: The police can’t do stuff to you just because they
want to; they need to make it clear what you did wrong. They
can never make you admit you broke a law.
Change Six: If you get in trouble, you can have a chance
to ﬁght about it in front of a group of normal people in a
deciding room, and you can always have someone who knows
about laws to help you if you want. If someone says you did
something bad, you get to talk to them face-to-face.
Change Seven: You can have your law ﬁght in front of a group
of normal people even if you’re not in trouble.
Change Eight: Police can’t be mean for fun, even to bad
people.
Change After Eight: People can do stuff not talked about here.
Change Ten: The country can only do the things these laws let
it do. The states can do whatever.

MORE CHANGES:
Change: People can’t have law ﬁghts with other states—only
their own.
Change: We changed the laws for how we pick leaders.
Change: We just had a big war with some states over whether
it’s okay to buy humans and force them to work. The side that
said “no” won. No more buying humans or forcing them to
work.
Change: Also, now that the war is over, we’re adding a number
of laws about what states can and can’t do to people.
Change: Oh, and people of any skin color can help pick leaders
and decide what the country will do.
Change: The country can take some of your pay to get money
for things we need.
Change: People, not a state’s leaders, pick the Law Makers who
will sit in the Serious Room.
Change: Let’s get rid of beer and wine.
Change: People of any sex can help pick leaders and decide
what the country will do.
Change: We moved up some of the days when new leaders take
over for the old ones, because we have cars now and don’t
need to allow a few months for people to travel.
Change: Never mind about getting rid of beer and wine.
Change: You can’t be the First Leader forever.
Change: People in the special town where the leaders and Law
Makers live can help pick leaders and decide what the country
will do, just like if they lived in a normal state.
Change: No making people pay to help decide things.
Change: We made it clearer what happens when a leader dies
or leaves.
Change: Younger people can help pick leaders now.
Change: If Law Makers decide to change how much they’re paid,
they don’t get the new pay until after the people in their state
have had a chance to decide whether to ﬁre them and pick
someone else.

The states
have never
tried making a
change using
the “law party”
idea, and no
one is really
sure how it
would work if
they did.
We made
these changes
right at the
start, because
some people
said they
wouldn’t agree
to join unless
we added this
stuff.
The way this
is worded has
been confusing
to people over
the years. Making things even
worse, when
it was written
down for the
different states
and Law Makers to agree to,
not all of them
saw it with the
same marks
between the
words.

Later, we got
a little clearer
about what
states can and
can’t do.
These are
changes we
made over the
next two hundred years.
We made
this change
because it
started feeling
strange that
the people
picked new
leaders, yet
the old ones
stayed in their
job for many
months.
. . . although
it’s somehow
still not completely clear,
even though
we’ve tried to
get it right like
three or four
times.
Some of the
states agreed
to this change,
but then it
got forgotten.
Later, we
found it and
other states
decided to
pass it.
The pay thing
it ﬁxes hasn’t
really been a
problem, but it
seems like an
okay enough
idea, so why
not!

THE US’S LAWS OF THE LAND
(A boat)
This boat is sometimes also called “Old
Metal Sides” because someone once tried
to make a hole in the side but couldn’t.
This boat was built to ﬁght in wars more
than two hundred years before this book
was written. Even though it’s old, it’s still
part of the country’s ﬁghting forces. That
means that if someone were attacking
the country with boats, and the country’s
leader said, “Send all our boats to that boat
ﬁght,” this one would have to go, too.

Of course, that’s not really going to happen,
since this boat is over two hundred years
old and would not help very much in a ﬁght.
Instead, the country keeps it around so they
can let people visit it, help people think
about the past, and teach everyone how old
boats worked.
Note: There are lots of special words for
things on boats. If you call this thing a
“boat,” people who know a lot about boats
might get mad at you.

When the boat was ﬁrst built, they put up a
message like this around the city:
Does anyone want to help their country? Our leader told
us to take this boat, which has lots of guns, and get it
ready to drive around on the sea as soon as we can.
We set up a place near the bird sign on Front Street and
need almost two hundred people to come help their
country for a year. We’ll pay ten (or more, if you’re good)
every month, with two months of pay ahead of time if you
want. No sick people.
This is a great chance for people around here to ﬁght
for our country and get even with anyone who hurts us.
Come to the place we talked about. We’ll be nice to you!
Signed, the leader of the boat.
Oh, also: Someone from the ﬁghting forces will be there
looking for ﬁghters and music players. Tall people only.

WIND POWER

LEADER

This boat was made before anyone had engines. It uses
wind to pull it around. It has three big wooden sticks—
sort of like trees—with lots of sheets hanging from them.
The wind pulls on the sheets, which pulls the boat.

BOAT RIDERS

If you want to go faster, you can put up more sheets.
But if the wind is very strong, you can’t put up too many
sheets or the trees will break.

This is how many
people usually rode

These are for
making holes in
other boats.

BIG GUNS
The boat’s guns were each
heavier than a car, and shot
metal balls that were almost as
big as a person’s head.

If the people want the boat to
stay where it is, they drop this
heavy, pointy metal thing into the
water on the end of a long line.
The metal drags on the bottom
and keeps the boat from moving
too far away. If they want to move
again, they can pull in the line to
bring the boat over the stopper—
so they’re pulling up on the line—
and the stopper will come free.

OUTSIDE
DEAD PEOPLE
When people who lived on the boat
died, the other people would put a
sheet around them and a piece of
metal and drop them in the water.

This part keeps the water out.
It’s made of wood from dead
trees. The kind of tree they
used is called a Live Tree.

FOOD-HEATING RADIO BOX
These boxes use radio waves to heat food.
Radio waves push on the tiny pieces water
is made of and make them go faster. When
tiny pieces in something move faster, that
thing gets hotter. If you send enough radio
waves through water, the water heats up.

Food-heating radio boxes can heat up cold
food you saved, and let you buy food that’s
full of ice, keep it for a long time, and then
heat it and get rid of the ice. These boxes
made it much easier for people to eat without spending a long time making their food.

You can also use a radio box to take fresh
food (like ﬁsh) and heat it up and turn it into
different kinds of food, just like you do with
the other heating boxes in your kitchen. But
it can be hard to use for that, so be careful,
especially with food made from animals.

Time teller

RADIO
Controls you
actually use

These radio boxes use exactly the same size of wave as the computer “hot spots”
in your house. Different kinds of radio machines use different sizes of waves, but
these two use the same size. There’s a reason for that.
At the same time food-heating radio boxes started being used a lot, people were
building more and more radios to send messages. Countries decided to leave
the wave size used by radio boxes (about hand-sized) open for anyone to use,
since radio boxes everywhere were already using it. When people started making
computer radios, they used that size, since it was one of the few sizes of wave
that anyone was allowed to use at home.

Lots of other
controls they
always add
even though
no one ever
wants them

Now, the whole world sends messages from their computers using the foodheating radio box wave size. It works fine—the only problem is that if there’s
a hole in your radio box, it can make the movie on your computer stop for a
moment while you make food.

WHY IS THERE ICE IN HOT FOOD?
Radio boxes are good at heating water but bad at
heating ice. They can heat ice, but it takes a long time.

ICE

Numbers

When you put iced food in a radio box, after a while,
parts of it start to turn to water. But since radio boxes
are really good at heating water, those parts start to
get hot really fast. They can even get so hot they start
turning to air—before all the ice is even gone!

WATER
HOT
WATER

Starter

To get around this problem, you can run the radio box
on low power, which will heat the food with lots of
pauses in between. That gives time for the hot parts to
spread out, and no one spot will get too warm.

SHAPE CHECKER
This machine checks whether you have a
piece of metal with a certain shape. If you
do, it lets go of whatever it’s holding on to.
People put these machines on boxes, doors,
and cars to try to control who can open or
use them.

What’s interesting about these machines
isn’t really the machine itself. There are
lots of different kinds that work in different
ways, but they’re all the same in one way:
They try to put people into groups.

By checking whether someone has a piece
of metal that’s the right shape, this machine
is really a way to try to tell whether people are who they say they are. It’s an idea—
about which people should be allowed to
do something—brought to life in metal.

HOW IT OPENS
BROKEN STICKS
To open the
machine, you
push a piece
of metal into
the hole. As
it goes in, the
sides of that
metal push the
sticks out of the
way. Because
of the shape
of the metal,
some sticks get
pushed farther
than others.

These sticks sit in holes, with one
end in a hole on the inside of the
box and one end in a hole in
the turner.

BAR
This bar holds two things
together. It turns around onto
itself, which makes the whole
thing sort of like a strangeshaped circle.
The bar goes through two
other circles. To move one
of those circles away from
the other, you need to move
them around the end of the
bar. But a circle doesn’t have
an end, so you need to make
the circle into a line—which
is what the machine decides
whether to let you do.

TOOTH
This piece of metal sticks into
the hole at the end of the bar, and
keeps it from lifting up. To lift the
bar, you have to pull this tooth out of
the hole in the bar, but it’s all hidden
inside the strong box. The only easy
way to pull on it is by moving the
turner with a piece of metal sticking
out through a hole in the box.

TOOTH PUSHER
This pushes the tooth into
the hole, so you can’t get it
out by shaking the machine.

Each stick is broken
somewhere along its
body, and every lock has
sticks that are broken
in different places. To
open the machine, you
need to know where
each stick is broken.
The strangely shaped
piece of metal that
opens the machine
holds that information,
and is a way of showing
the machine that you’re
allowed to open it.

STRONG BOX
This metal box
stops you from
touching or
seeing the inside
of the machine.
It’s very strong,
to make it hard
for people to
open it up.

STICK
PUSHERS

If your metal has the
right shape, each
stick will be pushed
just far enough that
the break in the
middle of it lines up
with the edge of the
turner. That lets you
move the turner using
the piece of metal.

These pushers
keep the end
of the broken
sticks pushed
into the turner.

By moving the
turner, you pull
the tooth out
of the hole in
the bar. Then
you can lift the
bar and move
the two circles
away from
each other.

BAR PUSHER
This pushes the
bar up once you
pull the teeth out.

TURNER
If you turn this
piece of metal,
it can pull the
tooth out of
the bar, but
because the
sticks are stuck
in it, you can’t
turn it without
using a piece
of metal with a
special shape.

TURNER
HOLE
To move the
turner, you stick
a piece of metal
in here. If it’s
the right shape,
the turner will
turn, which will
pull the tooth
out of the bar.

OTHER CHECKING MACHINES

LYING TO THE CHECKER

There are many other kinds of machines for checking
whether someone has something (like a piece of metal
or special information) and only opening if they do.

You can make a machine like
this open even if you don’t
have the right shape. Here’s
one way to do that:

OTHER SHAPE CHECKERS
Some kinds of machines need
different kinds of metal shapes.
This kind uses a circle shape, but
the idea of how it works is about
the same as the one shown above.

You start by pushing a thin
piece of metal into the hole
and gently turning.

While turning it, you reach in
with a second piece of metal,
and use the end to push on the
broken sticks one at a time. If
you lift a stick while using your
other hand to turn the turner,
the broken spot can get
caught on the turner’s edge.

As long as you keep trying to
move the turner, the stick will
stay stuck.When you get each
of the sticks stuck against the
turner, there will be nothing
left to stop it, and it will turn
and pull out the tooth.

NUMBER CHECKERS
Other machines check numbers
instead of shapes. If you know the
right numbers, you can make the
machine open.
These usually work using metal
wheels that turn. When the wheels
are all lined up in the right way, the
bar opens, but you have to know
which way to line the wheels up.
One problem a lot of these
machines have is that by turning
them and listening and feeling
very carefully, you can
sometimes figure out how the
wheels fit together.
And even if you can’t, you can
always just try all the numbers.
If you’re willing to wait, you
can open most simple number
checkers that way in a
few hours.

In some places, carrying these pieces of metal can get you in
trouble even if you don’t open anything with them.

And, of course, if you really need to
open one of these machines, there
are simpler ways to do it.

That’s sort of a strange law, since there’s nothing wrong with
using metal to turn a piece in a machine. Lots of people use
these to learn how shape checker machines work.
But carrying these pieces of metal can make people worried
for the same reason the machines are interesting—because
they’re not really machines. They’re a way of telling people
what you want to let them do. And that means these pieces
of metal are also seen as messages—the idea that you don’t
care what other people want.
So it makes sense that people worry about them, even if you
just want to learn about cool shape checkers.

LIFTING ROOM
A lifting room is a box that carries people
up and down in a building.
Today’s cities wouldn’t make sense without
lifting rooms. If we had tall buildings without them, everyone would want to stay on
their own ﬂoor, because going up or down
would take a lot more work than going the

same distance to the side. Tall buildings
might have to join up with each other, and
people would mostly move between them
while staying on their own ﬂoors.
Most lifting rooms go straight up and down.
A few go to the side while going up and
down, to take people to the top of a hill.

LIFTER

LINE STOPPER

These lifters usually
sit in a machine room
above the top floor the
lifting room can visit.
They use power to turn
a big wheel that pulls
a line running between
the room and a weight.

This thing listens to the different parts
of the machines, sometimes with the
help of a computer, and grabs the
line if anything goes wrong.

WEIGHT
This weight makes it
easier for the puller to
lift the room. It hangs
down on the other
end of the line holding
the room, so when
the puller at the top
lifts the room, it’s also
lowering the weight.

PULLING LINES
Lifting rooms are held
and lifted by a big
group of metal lines.
There are usually
around four to eight
of them, but it can be
more or less than that.
These lines are very
strong. Usually, even
just one of them
would be enough to
hold the whole room
on its own, but we use
more just to be safe.

METAL
STICK
LIFTING
ROOM
PRETEND
CONTROLS
There are controls on
the inside of a lifting
room that you use
to tell it where you
want to go. Some of
these controls, like the
one marked “DOOR
CLOSE,” don’t always
seem to do anything.
Some people say that
those controls don’t
even go anywhere,
because the lifting
room’s computer
knows when to open
and close the door
better than you do.
This is half true. On
some new lifting
rooms, the DOOR
CLOSE control
might not normally
do anything. This is
different in different
buildings; it’s up to
the person who owns
the building to decide
whether to make these
controls work.
But the DOOR OPEN
control is always
joined to the lifting
room’s systems, in
case fire fighters need
to take full control of
the lifters—by putting
a special key into the
control place—to use
them while fighting
a fire.

The line stopper
also grabs the line
when the room
stops at a floor to
make sure it doesn’t
move while people
get on and off. It’s
made so it will keep
holding on if the
power goes out.

There are also lifting rooms that only move
side to side; those are called trains.
Lifting rooms are safe; there’s almost no
way they can fall. There are a lot of different
parts that help lift them, and each part is
made to stop the room—instead of letting it
go—if something goes wrong.

POWER
FROM
BUILDING

LINE
HOLDER

Lifting rooms
use a lot of
power, but the
lights and air
systems in the
building use
even more.

TALL HALLWAY
The lifting room sits
inside a long hallway
that goes up and
down instead of to
the side. It can be
longer than any of
the normal hallways
in the building, but
most people never
see it.

FALL FEELER
This wheel is joined
to the room’s
stopping grabbers by
a line. As the room
moves up and down,
the wheel turns.
If the room starts
going down fast, the
wheel starts spinning
fast, and the little
arms in the middle of
the wheel swing out
and catch onto the
teeth around them.
This makes the wheel
stop turning, which
makes the room
suddenly pull on
the line—setting off
the room’s stopping
grabbers.

POWER LINE
This line brings
power for the lights
and controls in
the lifting room.
It sometimes runs
to the top of the
hallway, where the
pulling machines
are, or sometimes
to the side of the
wall part of the way
up the hallway.

GRABBERS
If the fall feeler
pulls on the line,
these grab the
metal stick really
hard and stop the
room from moving.

DOORS

If you face the back
wall instead of the
door, people will
think you’re strange.

These doors line up
with the doors on
the room. When the
lifting room stops,
both doors open
together.

WEIGHT LINE
This line is used in the
lifting rooms in tall
buildings to help keep
the weight on the
puller even.
When a room is all
the way at the top
or bottom, the lines
holding it add to the
weight on one side.
When that happens,
most of the weight
of this line hangs on
the other side, which
keeps things even.

EMPTY ROOM
Lifting rooms are
usually empty.
People don’t put
chairs or tables in
them except to
move those things
to other floors. If
you tried to use one
of these rooms as
an office, someone
would probably yell
at you.

CATCHER
If a lifting room
does fall, these
catchers hit a metal
plate on the bottom
of the room and
make the landing a
little softer.
There’s a
second catcher
for the weight.

BOAT THAT GOES UNDER THE SEA
At ﬁrst, we used those boats to shoot at
other boats, make holes in them, or stick
things to them that blew up.

We’ve always had boats that go under the
sea, but in the last few hundred years, we’ve
learned to make ones that come back up.

Later, we found a new use for these boats:
keeping our city-burning machines hidden,
safe, and ready to use if there’s a war.

WORLD-ENDING BOAT

BREATHING STICK

MIRROR LOOKERS

The boat shown here carries up to two dozen city-burning war machines.

This brings fresh air into the boat, but the boat
can also make its own air by breaking water into
the parts it’s made of. This takes a lot of power,
but the boat is powered by heavy metal, so it
has enough power to do whatever it wants.

When the boat is hiding under the sea,
it can come near the surface and use
these sticks with mirrors in them to let
the people inside see out of the water.

People have added up the power used during the Second World War—all
the machines that blew up, all the guns that fired, and all the cities that
burned. It’s a lot of fire power. Each of these boats carries several times
that much.

SPECIAL SEA WORDS HEAVY METAL POWER MACHINE
Most of the time, if you call
a really big boat a “boat,”
people who know a lot
about boats will get mad
at you. But boats that go
under the sea are really
called “boats.”

Pusher
Wing
turners

The normal people on the
boat sleep on either side of
the city-burning machines.

Any time heavy metal is used for power, people worry
about something going wrong. Of course, given what
these boats are built for, people worry even more
about the idea of one of them working right.

MACHINES FOR BURNING CITIES

A while ago, everyone decided the
world didn’t need so many city-burning
machines. This country agreed to turn
off four of the two dozen flying machine
carriers in each boat, leaving only twenty.

Each of these rooms has a flying carrier
full of city-burning machines. While hiding
under the water, the boats can shoot the
machines into space. Any of these boats
can send a machine anywhere in the
world in under an hour.

MACHINES FOR SHOOTING BOATS
This boat can shoot these tiny machines under
the water at other boats to make holes in them.
They blow up, but don’t use heavy metal.
Boats used to carry more guns and machines
like this, but boats don’t really fight each other
anymore.

These are some other boats, drawn to show how big
they are next to the world-ending boat above.

WORLD WAR BOAT

Light can’t go far under
water, so these boats “see”
with sound. The boat makes
sound, which hits things and
comes back. By listening
carefully, the people in the
boat can tell what’s around
them without seeing—just
like those skin birds that
catch flies in the dark.

SLEEPING ROOMS

These boats are powered by heavy metal, just like
some power buildings. This means they can stay
hidden for a long time without running out of power.

SOUND LOOKERS

THE FIRST ATTACK BOAT

This was used by one country in
the Second World War. It was
called an “Under-Sea Boat.”

This boat was used over two hundred years ago to
stick burning things to ships and blow them up.

SMALL ATTACK BOATS
These boats are big, but smaller than the ones
that carry our city-burning machines. They
carry machines that blow up houses, streets,
and other boats, but not whole cities.

NEVER-USED BOAT

DEEP GOER

BOAT FINDER

MOVIE MAKER DEEP GOER

These were built over a hundred
years ago, but kept hidden and
never fought.

Two people used
this boat to visit
the bottom of the
deepest place in
the sea.

This was used to find
a huge boat that had
hit some ice long
ago and fallen to the
bottom of the sea.

A man made a movie about the huge
boat that hit some ice and broke,
then used the money to buy this boat
and take it to the deepest part of the
sea. (He didn’t go there to make a
movie. He just likes the sea.)

(That’s not too strange; today’s
world-ending boats also hide
and have never fought.)

HOW DEEP THEY GO
The sea is very deep. Most boats can’t go very far
down or their walls will break under the weight of the
water. To go to the bottom of the sea in most places
takes special boats.

BIG ANIMALS

These animals are
smaller than our big
fighting boats, but
some of them can

PEOPLE
Most of the time, even with the
help of metal air holders, people
can’t go deeper than a few
hundred feet (at least, not if they
want to come back up).
People without extra air
sometimes also go that deep
and come back up, but those
people die a lot.

FIGHTING BOATS
Most fighting boats can only go a few times farther
down than than they are long. That’s not very deep;
when a boat is hiding under the sea, the water below
it can be ten or even a hundred times deeper than the
water above it.
But where they go is deep enough to hide and be
safe, so they don’t need to go any deeper.

ANIMALS
The large air-breathing
animal with teeth can go far,
far down into the sea. They
go there to eat animals with
many arms.
Sometimes the air-breathing
animals come back up
covered in little cuts and
holes, so the animals with
arms must fight back, but no
one has ever seen it happen.

THE DEEP SEA FLOOR
Only three people have ever
been there—two in the deep
goer and the movie maker.

about these machines start living together,
this can even lead to ﬁghts.

If you ﬁll a cleaning box the wrong way, it
may not clean well. After people see this
happen a few times, they can get strong

Some ideas are clear to everyone—like that
you should always point cups down, so
they don’t end up full of food water. There’s

more, but you don’t need to ﬁght over it!
There’s a book that goes with your plate
cleaner, and it shows how you should ﬁll
it. (If you’ve lost the book, you can usually
read it for free using a computer.)

SMALL CUP
HOLDER

TOP HOLDER
The top holder
usually has its own
thrower, although
older cleaners
often used one in
the middle.

Cup-shaped things need to face down,
or else they can fill with food water.
Sometimes light things turn over
when water hits them. You can try to
use heavier things to hold them in
place, but it doesn’t always work.

ROLLERS

This holder is
for small cups,
or knives, or
anything that fits.

“TOP HOLDER ONLY”

FACE DOWN

Some knives and cups say “Top holder
only.” This doesn’t have anything to do
with the water—it’s because there’s
a heater at the bottom, and some
plastic things can start to bend
if they’re too close to the heat.

If you have
something light
that turns over a
lot, you can put it
under this holder.

These let you roll
the plate holders
in and out.

TURNING
Throwers have
holes that point a
little to one side,
so when the water
goes out that
way, it will push
the thrower in the
other direction.
That’s what makes
them spin around.

BIG FLAT ROCKS WE LIVE ON
The surface of the Earth is made up of big
ﬂat rocks moving around. The rocks under
land areas are usually thick, slow-moving,
and last for a long time, and the ones under

seas are thin, heavy, and move fast. (Fast
for a rock, that is. They move about as fast
as the things on the ends of your ﬁngers
grow.) When a sea rock hits a land rock, the

pushed down as they
run into the land rocks. But that doesn’t happen very often, so
people try not to worry about it too much.

DEEP PART

sea rock is usually pushed under it, down
into the Earth. Areas where this happens often have deep seas right near land, lines of
mountains, shaking ground, and big waves.

HOT ROCK MOUNTAIN

ROCK MOUNTAIN

The rocks that get pushed
into the Earth get hot and
watery, and some of them
come up through holes in
the rock above them. They
come out of those holes
and cool down and turn into
mountains.

Not all the mountains
in this kind of place are
made from hot rock. When
a sea plate goes under
a land plate, it can make
mountains by pushing up
on the land plate.
If two land plates hit,
it can make very big
mountains. The biggest
mountains on Earth right
now were made this way.

Small Soft, the
company that
makes Windows®,
is in a city like this.

LAND FLOOR
SEA
FLOOR

LAND ROCKS
These are like big
rock boats that
drive around on
top of the hotter
rocks under them.

SEA ROCKS
Sea rocks are heavy. They slide along like a moving road,
and they move fast! Not as fast as a person, but faster
than most kinds of land.
When sea rocks hit land rocks, the sea rocks usually get
pushed back down under the land rocks, down into the
Earth, where they break down. Because most sea rocks
run into land and disappear after a while, most parts of
the sea floor aren’t as old as the land floor.

DEEP ROCK
This part of the world can be hard to
understand. Sometimes people talk
about it like it’s watery, but sometimes
they talk about it like it’s hard.
The real truth is that it’s very hard. If you
touched a piece of it, it would feel very
hard. (You shouldn’t touch it, though,
because it would also set your hand on
fire.) It’s harder than the hardest metal,
glass, or even stones in a marriage ring.
That makes it sound a lot like rock, not
water.
But in some ways, it also acts like water.
It’s sort of like the big rivers of ice that
slide slowly down from mountains. The
ice is hard up close, and you can walk on
it and break pieces off. But if you look
at it from far away, and wait a very long
time, you’ll see that it moves like water.

WATER-CARRYING ROCKS
Sea water gets carried inside the
Earth here. The water changes the
rocks in a way that helps the rock
go back up through the rocks
above it and come out of holes in
the ground.

WHEN THE EARTH SHAKES, SOMETIMES THERE ARE BIG WAVES.
THIS IS THE KIND OF SHAKING THAT MAKES THE BIGGEST WAVES:
The reason the sea floor
moves is that these rocks
are heavier than the deep
rock below them, and their
weight pulls on the sea
floor as they fall down into
the Earth.
The land rocks move too,
even though most of the
time they stay on top and
don’t fall into the Earth.
We don’t understand
exactly what pushes them.

DEEP
ROCK

There’s a place in my
country on the edge
of the sea. (They once
made a game for kids
about trying to get to this
place. You had to cross
rivers and shoot animals
for food and sometimes
people in your family
died. It was supposed
to teach you about the
past, but I just played the
shooting part and never
learned very much.)

not lying down. They’re
sticking up from the
sea floor, like they grew
there. That shouldn’t be
possible, because those
trees can’t grow in sea
water. The sea rises and
falls, but the trees only
died 300 years ago,
and the sea hasn’t risen
enough to explain how
these trees grew there.

Right by the water,
there’s something very
strange: dead trees in
the sea. There are lots
of dead trees in the sea.
But what’s strange about
these trees is that they’re

On the other side of the
sea, 300 years ago, there
was a big wave. People
who saw it wrote about it.
They also wrote that they
didn’t feel the ground
shake before the wave.

The reason they didn’t
feel the ground shake is
that the shaking didn’t
happen near them. It
happened far away,
across the sea, in the
place from the kids’ game.
And by the edge of the
water, the ground went
down a little bit, and the
sea came in and covered
the trees.

The answer is that the sea
didn’t rise. The land fell.

WHERE DO ROCKS GO AFTER THEY DIE?

It’s strange to think
that all these things are
under you right now.

DEEPER ROCK

We used to think that
when rocks fell into the
Earth, they broke up
right away from the heat.
And even if they stayed
together for a little while,
it didn’t really matter,
since they were hidden
away forever. That part of
our history was gone.

But it turns out they’re
not quite gone. When the
world shakes, we can listen
to the sound go around
and through the world. By
listening very carefully, we
can hear the sound hitting
things inside the Earth,
and learn what it’s like in
there.

By listening to the Earth,
we’ve learned that the
rocks don’t all turn to
water right away. We can
keep track of them, even
when they’re out of reach
of our eyes, as they fall
down, down, down into
the Earth.
I think that’s really cool.

CLOUD MAPS
The air changes every day. Every day, clouds
move around, rain comes and goes, and
winds change. And every day, people all
over the world try to ﬁgure out what the air
is doing and where the rain will go next.

To make maps of the sky, we use space
boats looking at clouds from above, radio
waves looking at clouds from the side, and
people all over the world looking at clouds
from below.

LOWS (RAIN MAKERS)
Areas with lighter air over them are called
“lows.” Air moves across the ground
toward those areas, and—just like water
moving toward a hole in the bottom of a
pool—it goes faster and starts moving in
a circle.

HIGHS AND LOWS
These lines show how hard the air is pressing down on different areas of the map—
which is sort of a strange idea, but important for understanding rain and wind.

Air usually rises up in these “light” areas,
which makes rain. As the air rises, the
water in the air cools down and turns into
little drops, just like water on the side of a
glass with a cold drink in it.

These maps are a lot like maps used to show the shape of mountains. The lines join
areas where the air is pressing down with the same weight, and the middles of circles
are areas where air is especially heavy or light. They’re marked “Heavy” and “Light” (or
“High” and “Low”) to help you know which is which.

COLD AIR

This area will have heavy rain
(or snow, if it’s cold enough.)
This area will have light
wind and light rain.

This area will
be cold and
clear.

COOL AIR

This area will have
strong, cold winds
and heavy rain.

HIGHS (CLEAR AREAS)
In a “heavy” (or “high”) area, air is
pressing down hard, which keeps
wet air from rising and keeps clouds
and rain from forming. These areas
usually have clear skies and not very
much wind.

COOL AIR
This area
will be cool.
This area will be
clear and warm
for now.

WARM AIR
The dark areas
on this map show
where it will rain.

GREAT CIRCLE STORMS
These storms are a kind of “low” powered by the heat
carried by sea water as it turns to air and rises from the
surface when warmed by the Sun. They have very strong
winds in a circle near the center, but right in the center
it’s calm—and can even be clear. People call this clear
area the “eye” of the storm.

This area may see
flashes of light in the
sky and winds strong
enough to blow away
a house.

When these storms come in from the sea, they bring the
sea with them. Their winds push water ahead of them,
and it can make the sea come up onto the land and cover
whole cities. They can also make so much rain that rivers
rise and wash away people, cars, and houses.
Thanks to computers, we’ve gotten a lot better at
guessing where circle storms are going to go, which
helps us to tell people to get out of the way.
Around here, the air stops
getting colder as you go higher,
so warm air stops rising.

Warm air
Cold air

This piece of cloud
sticking up means
warm air is rising so
fast that it shoots up
above where it would
normally stop. It means
the storm is very strong.

COLD AIR COMING IN

WARM AIR COMING IN

VERY BIG SUMMER STORMS

This line shows where cold air is coming in.
This can mean there will be wind, and then
flashes of light, sounds from the clouds, and
very, very heavy rain, but it doesn’t last long.

This line means warm air will be moving into an
area. This can mean there will be clouds ahead
of the warm air, sometimes a few days before it
gets there, and rain as it moves in.

Sometimes, on hot days, air heated by the
sun rises up very fast, then cools and pours
down rain. These storms can make spinning
wind that blows away houses.

THINGS YOU SEE ON RADIO MAPS AND WHAT THEY MEAN
Sky-watching stations point radio waves at clouds. If there are big drops of water in the
clouds, the radio waves hit them and come back. By pointing the radio in different directions,
the people in the stations can make a map of all the rain and snow in clouds around them.
Here’s how to understand some of the shapes you see on those maps:

RAIN
Big shapes like
this mean rain. It
will probably last a
while and be light
sometimes and
heavy other times.

SOUND
STORM
This shape
means a storm
is coming, which
may bring light,
sound, and
strong wind.

WIND STORM

SPINNING WIND

SKIN BIRDS

TREES

GROUND

This shape means
a storm with lights
and sound is coming,
and the wind ahead
of it might be even
stronger than normal.

This shape, like a bent finger,
means a spinning cloud is
touching the ground, and may
be tearing up trees and houses.

This circle shape isn’t
rain—it’s hundreds and
hundreds of little skin
birds all flying out of
a big hole to eat flies
when the Sun sets.

When there’s
no rain to see,
sometimes the
map shows little
lines of noise from
the radio waves
hitting the tops of
trees and houses.

This shape happens
when the radio
waves hit clouds,
then a pool of water
on the ground, then
come back. That
makes them take
longer, so it looks
like there’s rain far
away.

Sometimes, if you look at the
shapes made by the radio, you
can see the stuff the storm has
picked up. It looks like a small
ball in the middle of the bent
finger shape.

Sometimes other
animals, like normal
birds or flies, show up
on these maps too.

LEAVES
Trees make power from
the Sun’s light using leaves.
The green stuff in leaves
eats light (and the kind of
air we breathe out) and
turns it into power (and the
kind of air we breathe in).

TREE

GRAY TREE-JUMPER
These little animals sleep in
big round houses made of
sticks and leaves high up in
the branches.

GROWING UP
Trees grow taller only
by making the ends of
their branches longer.
The spot where a branch
joins the main part of the
tree is never lifted higher.

POINTY CAT
This animal walks around
slowly, climbing trees and
eating leaves and sticks.
It’s covered in sharp
points that can stick in
your skin, so most animals
don’t bother it.

BIRD HOLES
Some birds
make holes, but
a lot of them just
use holes other
birds make.

TALL AND WIDE TREES
The same kind of tree can grow
tall or wide. If there are other
trees around, they’ll grow mostly
up, each one trying to get above
the others to reach the Sun’s light.
If a tree is growing alone in a field,
it will spread branches out to the
sides so it can catch more light.

QUIET NIGHT CATCHER
These birds fly very quietly and
have big eyes to catch animals
on the ground in the dark.
People think of them as
knowing a lot of things,
although that may just be
because they’re quiet and
have big eyes.

DRINK
HOLES

TREE-EATING FLOWERS

LOUD JUMPERS

This flower makes holes in
trees and steals food and water
from inside them. If the flowers
get big, they can kill the
branches they’re growing on,
or even kill the whole tree.

These two kinds of
tiny animals make loud
noises and are known for
jumping. One has bones.

When people stand under this
flower at a party, other people
tell them to kiss.

SKIN BURNER
These leaves have stuff
on them that makes your
skin turn red. It gives you a
really bad feeling, like you
need to rub your skin with
something sharp, but doing
that only makes it worse.

These were
made by a
head-hitting
bird looking
for tree blood
to drink.

If you find a forest of tall thin trees with one wide tree
with low branches in the middle, it might mean the forest
you’re in was someone’s field a hundred years ago.

HEAD-HITTING BIRD

When flashes of power
from storms hit a tree, they
can burn a line in the wood.

ANIMAL HILL
This is the dirt the
walking flies took out
of the ground while
making their holes.

DOOR

When people cut down a forest, sometimes they leave a
few trees—to make a cool shadow area, or because the
tree looks nice—and those trees will grow out into the
new space.
If the forest grows back, the new trees—fighting with
each other as they grow—will be tall and thin.

STORM BURN

This leaf-flower grows in
long lines across the ground
or up trees. Sometimes it
grows into the air like a
small tree of its own. Like
many things, its leaves
come in groups of three.

FIELD TURNING INTO FOREST

BIRD
HOUSE

BROKEN BRANCH HOLE
When a tree gets hurt, like
if a branch breaks off, the
place where it got hurt grows
differently, just like when skin
gets cut. Sometimes animals
get in through these spots and
make the hole bigger.

SKIN

This kind of bird hits trees
with its head, making holes
in the wood with its sharp
mouth. They make holes to
find things to eat, and some
also make holes to live in.

The outer skin of trees is where growing
happens and where they carry food up
and down. Cutting off a ring of skin all the
way around a tree will kill it.
Trees grow by adding new layers, and
grow differently in different parts of the
year. If you cut open a tree, you can see
old layers, and count them to tell how
many years old the tree is.

DIRT BRANCHES
Trees grow branches down
into the ground, like the ones
in the air. The air branches get
light from the Sun, while the
ground branches get water
and food from the dirt. They
spread way out—often farther
than the air branches—but
usually not very deep.

TREE-FOOD STEALER
Instead of growing dirt branches
of their own, these flowers grow
onto the dirt branches of other
trees and steal food from them.
Some of these little flowers
don’t even have green leaves
and can’t make their own food
from light.

LITTLE
HOLEMAKERS

LONG-HOLE MAKERS

They usually don’t fly, and they’re not
much like house flies. They’re in the same
group with the kinds of flies whose back
end has a sharp point that can hurt you.

Then, many years later,
if someone needs to cut
down the tree, their saw
can hit the metal and
send tiny sharp pieces
flying everywhere.

These holes are from fires long
ago. The leaves and sticks on
the ground burned, and the
wind blew the fire against this
side of the tree. The burned
spot grows in a different way
and can sometimes turn into
a large hole.

LONG-EAR
JUMPERS

These tiny animals live in big groups and
make holes. Most of them don’t have
babies; each family has one mother who
makes all the new animals for the house.

When people use metal
to stick signs to trees,
sometimes the tree
grows around the metal
and eats it up.

FIRE HOLE

TINY
DOG

WALKING FLIES

OLD METAL

LONG BITERS WITHOUT ARMS OR LEGS
(SLEEPING)
These long thin cold-blooded animals don’t usually
hang out together, and sometimes eat each other.
During the winter, though, lots of different kinds
come together and sleep all wrapped up together
in big holes under the ground where it’s warmer.

BIG HOLE-MAKERS
DIRT-BRANCH LIFE
Most trees and flowers have life growing on their
dirt branches. This life helps them talk to the other
trees and flowers around them. They can even use
this life to share food or attack each other.
If something tries to eat one tree, it can tell other
trees through messages carried by this ground life,
and the other trees can start making bad water
and other things to make themselves harder to eat.

MACHINE FOR BURNING CITIES
At the end of the biggest war in history, less After the war, we learned to make the ﬁre

Two of the machines were used in that war,
and each one burned a city and killed many,
many people.
THE MACHINE
THE FIRST RUN-AWAY FIRE
Everything is made of tiny pieces. Around
the start of the Second World War, we
learned that the pieces of a few special
heavy metals could be made to break
in half. We also learned that when they
break, they let out a little flash of heat
and some tiny fast pieces.

Everyone worried that a new war would
start at any minute. We spent many years
like that, each side waiting for the other to
attack and start the war that would end the
world.
We’re less afraid now, and most people
don’t think that war will happen. But we still
have the machines.

The first machines had one part that blew up, but a few years later, we
learned to make the fire a lot bigger by putting two parts together.
The top part uses a normal fire to start the run-away fire in the special metal.
Then the bottom part uses that special fire to start an even bigger run-away
fire in a light air or metal. That second fire is the kind that powers the Sun.
The light metal’s run-away fire can let out even more power than the heavy
metal kind, but it takes so much heat and force to get it started that we can
only do it with the help of a run-away fire in a heavy metal.

use to blow

The clouds of little

aren’t important for the
run-away fire; we can
ignore them.

TINY FIRE

PART

RUN-AWAY FIRE

This is for adding
some special air, right
before the machine
goes off, to help the
run-away fire start.

NORMAL METAL

When the heavy center
of one of the metal
pieces breaks in half, it
lets out heat and some
pieces. If those pieces
hit another center, the
same thing happens,
letting out more heat
and pieces. Soon, the
whole piece of metal can
become a run-away fire.

This helps hold the
special heavy metal
together as the runaway fire starts.

HEAVY METAL
This is where the
first run-away fire
happens.

IN-BETWEEN
STUFF

ENOUGH METAL
If the piece of metal is
too small, the little pieces
from the broken center
can fly out without hitting
any other centers.

SECOND
PART

For a run-away fire to
start, there needs to be
enough metal to make
sure the flying pieces hit
other centers instead of
flying out.

We don’t know what
this is made of; the
machine makers have
kept that hidden.
When the light fills
the inside of the
box, it gets bigger
and pushes the
second part
together.

Here’s how the first run-away fire
sets off the second one.

First, a message
goes down a line
and starts some
tiny fires.

The tiny fires
set off the fire
plastic, which
starts to blow up.

The blowing-up
plastic pushes
the heavy metal
together.
When the metal
gets small
enough, the runaway fire starts.
As it burns, the
metal puts out
a bright light—
brighter than
anything but a
dying star.
The light heats up
the in-between
stuff, making it
push the second
part together hard.
That starts a
run-away fire in
the light metal.

WALL

HOW MUCH IS “ENOUGH”?

This helps
hold in the
light from
the first
part so it
can push on
the second
part.

The size of a piece of metal it takes
to make a run-away fire is different
for different metals and different
shapes, but it can be a piece small
(Don’t do this.) enough for a person to pick up.
Even if a piece isn’t big enough, pushing it into a
small space can make it blow up, because when
the centers are closer together, there’s less room
between them for the fire to get out.

MORE HEAVY
METAL
LIGHT METAL OR AIR
This stuff can also burn in a run-away fire, but it
has to be pushed together really hard first.

HOW WE SEND THEM

GOING TO SPACE (BUT NOT FOR LONG)

The first city-burning war machines were
dropped from sky boats. Later, we learned
to put them on fast up goers instead.

The city-burning machine carrier flies up to space.
Like most up goers, the machine carrier drops parts
once they’re used up, so it can go faster and faster.

City-burning machine
carriers work a lot like
the up goers that fly
people up to space.

It goes almost fast enough to stay in space and go
around the Earth.

In fact, some of those
people carriers are just
city-burner carriers
without the city-burning
part at the end.

THE SECOND
RUN-AWAY FIRE

Almost, but not quite.

This fire makes
the other fire
even worse, and
the whole thing
blows up.
After the first
run-away fire
begins, the whole
thing happens in
the time it takes
light to go a few
hundred feet.

When the light
metal or air is
pushed together,
it also starts another run-away fire here. These run-away
fires help make each other stronger.
By adding more and more steps like this, we found we
could make the fires as big as we wanted, and at first we
built the machines larger and larger.
But then we stopped making the machines larger, and
started making them smaller, instead. We didn’t stop
because we didn’t want to burn larger cities. We just
realized you could burn a city more easily with a few
small machines than one big one. Soon, we had enough
small machines to burn as many cities as we wanted.
We stopped making the machines larger because the
ones we had were big enough to burn everything. There
was nothing larger to burn.

WATER ROOM
This is one of the best things humans have
ever built.

We’ve learned that often, when we get sick,
it’s because a kind of life has gotten into our
bodies and is trying to grow in us. Our body
can often ﬁght this off, but while we’re ﬁghting it, it uses the things that come out of our
body—often, by helping more of them come
out—to spread itself to other people.

Over the past few hundred years, we’ve
learned a lot about why people get sick.
We’ve learned how the things travel that
make us sick, and we’ve learned ways to
stop them.
WATER
BRINGER

OPENER
When you

push this up
and down,
it opens and
closes the
hole at the
bottom of
the catcher.

By learning how to bring water into our
buildings, and how to make it carry things
away from our bodies without touching others, we’ve found a way to ﬁght back against
the things that have killed so many of us.
This is an important room!

OLD HOUSE:

WALL SOUNDS
Sometimes, when you
turn off the water in an
old house, you hear a
loud sound from the
wall, like a big rock
hitting something.
That’s the sound of
water hitting a stopper.
When you turn on
the water bringer in a
house, there’s a long
train of water all moving
together toward the
hole where it’s coming
out. When you turn it
back off, all that water has to stop.

AIR HOLE TO ROOF
There’s usually some air in the smelly water that’s
going out of the room. This carrier lets that air
rise up and out a hole in the roof, instead of
coming back up through the hole in your room
and making everything smell bad.

NEW HOUSE:

HOW WE FIXED THEM
Newer houses fix this by
adding a piece to the water
bringer. The piece is a deadend area, above the water,
which is full of air. When the
water stops, it can go up
into the dead end. The soft
air in the dead end acts like
a spring, slowing the water
down gently so there’s no
loud noise.

Water moves around a lot, but it can’t really
get smaller. When the front part of the water
train hits the stopper, since it can’t get smaller,
there’s no place for it to go. It all has to stop
right away. The force of the water train all
stopping at once hits the metal around it really
hard, making a loud noise.

SMELLY

WHY IS “HOT” ON THE LEFT?
SMELLY AIR

HOT WATER
WATER BRINGER
When you push this thing, it opens the
bottom of this pool and pours water
down into the cup, making everything run
out the bottom and away.
This also starts water coming back in. As
it rises, it lifts a little air bag. When the air
bag rises high enough, it makes the water
turn back off.

In the past, water bringers had
a hand-powered water pusher.
They put it on the right side, since
most people are right handed.
They only brought cold water.

When we started adding
hot-water bringers, we put
them on the other side,
since people were used
to the cold-water bringer
being where it was.

the hole and make your room smell bad.

People like to
make these in

animal feet for
some reason.

COMPUTER BUILDING
When you use a computer to listen to songs
or watch movies, sometimes they’re on your
computer, but often they’re “in the cloud.”
“The cloud” is just a lot of buildings owned
by big companies. They’re full of rows of
computers, information boxes, and lots of
confusing colored lines everywhere joining
everything together, carrying information

and power in and out of the computers.
When you use things like Short Bird Talk and
Face Book, your computer is talking to computers in buildings like this.
Some computer buildings were built by
companies to hold all their own computers.
Some very big companies do this. Other
computer buildings sell space to people

who have computers but need somewhere
to put them. Some let you use their computers if you pay. Many have computers, and if
you pay them, they use their computers to
do things for you. But the computers in all
these buildings usually look about the same.

FIRE-STOPPING AIR

COOLERS

COLD AND WARM HALLS

SPECIAL ROOMS MEET-ME ROOM (That’s the real name.)

If something catches fire in a
computer building, the building’s
systems will often open up boxes
full of heavy air. Fire needs stuff
that’s in our air so it can burn. If
you put another kind of air in its
place, the fire stops.

Computers make heat.
One of the hardest
things about running
a computer building
is keeping it cool. A
lot of the power these
buildings use goes
for running blowers in
every room, pushers
to move cooling water
up to the roof and
back, and running
the big coolers on
the roof that cool the
cooling water down.

Floors are laid out in rows,
with cold halls and warm halls
between them. The cold halls are
on the side where computers pull
air in, and the warm halls are on
the side where the air is blown
out of the computers. That way,
computers aren’t blowing hot air
into other computers on the side
where they’re pulling air in.

If you have your
own computers and
computer holders,
you can pay for a
room to yourself.
You can bring any
computers you want
and join them up
with the building’s
systems.

(The special air fires need to
burn is the same kind of air we
need to breathe, so if you’re in
the room when they send in the
other air, you can die. But at
least you won’t be on fire.)

Sometimes, different companies have
computers in the same computer building,
and they want to send things to each other.
Normally, they would have to send stuff out
of the building into the world, and then pay
information-carrying companies to bring it
to the other company’s computers—even if
those computers were in the same building
where it started. Some computer buildings
have a room where different companies
can all join up their computers and share
stuff with each other without having to go
outside or pay other companies to carry
their messages.

WAIT CONTROL

If there’s a fire, and the building
starts to fill itself with firestopping air, press this control.
It tells the building, “Wait, don’t

FIRE WATER

POWER BOXES

KEEPING THE POWER ON
The people who run computer buildings
worry a lot about the power going out.
They usually have lots of power boxes to
keep themselves running for a short time
if the power dies, and some machines for
burning fire water to make power if the
power stays off for a long time.

POWER WATCHER

POWER CHANGER

This machine decides
where to get the power
to send up to the
computer floors. If the
outside power dies, the
machine changes over
to using the power
boxes without letting
anything turn off.

Computer buildings use a lot of power, so the kind of power
they get from the power company isn’t like the power to a
house—that kind is too hard to send a long way. Instead, they
get the kind of power that runs through those long lines that
you sometimes see hanging from tall metal things high above
the trees out in the country.
These boxes change that power into the normal kind of
power computers need. They make things a lot easier, except
when they blow up. But most days they don’t blow up.

HOLDER
Computer buildings keep all their computers in these
holders. A holder can hold all kinds of computer parts;
anyone can easily put any kind of computer in any
computer building.

COMPUTER
Computer buildings use a special kind of computer that fits
well in a holder. It’s about the size of the back of a chair.

POWER SENDER

MEMORY STICKS

BACK

TALKING CENTER

This takes power from
the outside and sends it
to different parts of the
computer.

These hold things the
computer is thinking about,
like information it’s sending
or pictures it’s looking at. If
the computer turns off, this
goes away.

If you want to add a line into
the computer, you usually
run it in through a hole here.

A few spots on the holder hold the talking center, which
is where the lines from all the other computers go so
they can talk to the outside world. This usually goes at
the top.

CARD-HOLDER
These are spaces where you can put in
a few more smaller add-on computers.
These might do things like talk to other
computers faster than normal, or do
special work with numbers.

BLOWERS
These blow air
through the
computer to
keep it cool.
The air always
blows from the
front to the
back, into
the warm
hallway.

INFORMATION HOLDERS
THINKING BOXES
These are the main
centers where the
computer follows
steps and moves
numbers around.

These computers hold almost nothing but
memory. They’re made so you can take the
information boxes out while the computer
is running and put in new ones. (When you
have this many of them, they break pretty
often, and you have to do that a lot.)

GRABBERS
These join the
computer to the
computer holder.

FRONT
This part usually has some lights to tell you how the
computer is doing, and a little sticker with a name or picture
that tells you what company made the machine. Since
you’re usually seeing it because you’re fixing a problem, the
sticker just tells you who you should be angry at.

INFORMATION
BOXES
These boxes remember
things even when the
computer turns off.

TALKING CENTER
Lots of lines run up here.
Other lines run from
here out into the world.
Sometimes, to carry more
information, those lines are
made of glass, and use light
instead of power.

POWER LINES
Each computer has two
power lines, which can look
a lot like the information
lines. If they used the same
kind of ends to join to the
computer, there would be
a lot of problems, but they
don’t.

INFORMATION LINES
Each computer usually has
three different information
lines. One is to talk to
computers in the outside
world and another is to talk
to other computers in the
building that are owned by
the same company. The third
is a special computer building
system used to do things like
turn the computer on and off
or change how it works.

INFORMATION BOXES
MEMORY GROUPS

EMPTY SPOTS FOR MORE
INFORMATION BOXES

The memory boxes in
some computers are
joined together so that
even if one or two of the
boxes break, the others
still have all the stuff they
were remembering.

NORMAL
COMPUTERS
These computers have
some memory, but
they’re mostly for doing
work and talking to other
computers. If you get a
message from someone,
or look at someone’s
page on Face Book, Short
Bird Talk, or Faller, your
computer is probably
talking to one of these.

PROBLEM
Someone is probably going
to fall and pull this out.

ANOTHER PROBLEM
These lines are really
confusing. They always start
out nice and clean, and then
over time the whole thing
becomes a wall of color that
makes no sense.

ANOTHER PROBLEM
Someone forgot the power
lines to this computer, which
is probably why your phone
has no service right now.

OTHER COMPUTERS
You can bring your own
computers and put them
in the computer holder.
As long as you pay for
the space and don’t break
anything, the people who
own the building don’t
care what kind they are
or how old they are.

After people visited the house a few times, it

SKY BOAT PUSHER
Sky boats, like cars and sea boats, are
pushed by machines that burn ﬁre water.
Fire water needs air to burn, and sky boat
pushers use special blowers that use the air
they’re moving through to feed their ﬁre.

Most machines that burn ﬁre water use these
four steps: First, pull air in. Second, push the
air together. Third, burn ﬁre water in the air,
heating it and making it get bigger. Last, use
that growing air to push on something.

Sky boat pushers use the force from the hot
air in two ways: They let it ﬂy out the back,
pushing them like a space boat, but they
also use it to turn their own blowers, pulling
in more air and keeping themselves running.

KINDS OF PUSHERS

HOW DO THEY WORK?

Small sky boats and large ones all work by pushing air, but different kinds
of sky boats use different kinds of pushers.

To understand how air pushers work, it can help to start by looking at space pushers.
To make a fire, you need air and something to burn. Space boats pour fire
water and air into a little room that’s open on one side. Then the water and
air is set on fire. The fire blows up and flies out the hole, pushing the boat.

SIMPLE PUSHER
These are fun to play with, but if you try to push
any kind of boat with them, your arms get tired.

Since there’s no air in space, but fires need air, a space boat has to carry
air with it. Sky boats can use the air around them, so they only need to
carry the fire water. They can take in air, add fire water to it, and burn it.

POWERED PUSHER

You can make the pusher better by using a blower in the front to force
more air together into the burning room. If there’s more air, the fire can
burn faster and hotter.

These are even more fun to play
with (though you probably want
to put them on a sky boat first).

Running the blower in front takes power. You could get that power by
burning fire water in a different machine and running power to the blower
with power lines. But it’s better to just use a little of the power from the
fire you’re already making.

FIRE PUSHER
These are used to push fast boats, like the kind
that fight in wars. They go fast, but use more
fire water than other kinds.

If you put a blower in back, in the path of the fire, it can turn a stick that
turns the blower in the front. This blower slows down the burning air so
it doesn’t push you as well. But the blower makes the fire work so much
better that it more than makes up for it.

FIRE-POWERED BLOWER
These are like the fire pushers, but with a big
blower added to the front. This kind of pusher
is very good if you don’t want to go too fast.
They’re very loud.

There’s one last idea that makes this work better. Instead of just using the
hot air to power the blowers that press the air into the burning room, you
can also use it to power a big blower.
This big blower (which sometimes has a wall around it) is what really
pushes the sky boat. Once you add this blower, all the rest of the parts are
just there to get lots of air together, start a fire, and get power from it.

BIG SKY BOAT PUSHER
These are like fire-powered blowers, but
they have a wall around the whole thing
to control how the air goes through.
They only work well when you’re going
slower than sound, which is why almost
no big sky boats go faster than that.

WAIT A SECOND!
One thing a lot of people wonder is “How does the force from
the fire know to go out the back? Why doesn’t it push on the
blowers in front just as much, and slow them back down?”
The answer is that the shape of the room and the size of the
blowers make it so the easier way out is through the back.
It just has to push through a few blowers on the way.

STEP ONE:
GET AIR

STEP TWO:
PUSH

STEP FOUR: MAKE POWER

STEP THREE: BURN

hotter.

BLOCKER
If there’s stuff
in the air, like
sticks or rocks,
it gets pushed
through here so
it doesn’t hurt
the blowers.

The force of the air coming out would help push the sky boat on its own,
but sky boat pushers do something cooler: They put extra blowers in
the path of the air. Instead of turning those blowers to push air, they let
the air turn the blowers. The blowers turn the stick in the middle of the
pusher, which turns all the blowers at the start, powering the machine.
That might seem like it shouldn’t work, since it’s using a blower to power
another blower. But the power is coming from the burning fire water
pushing its way out. These
blowers are just a cool
way to use some of
that fire to keep the
machine running.

POINT
This thing helps
to start pushing
the air together
before it goes
inside.

BIG BLOWER
The fire in the
back turns this
big blower using
the stick in the
middle. This
blower is what
really does most
of the work
of pushing a
big sky boat;
everything else
is just there to
turn it.
Not all sky boats have
a big blower like this.
Some of them just
use the hot air itself,
which works well for
very fast boats. But
for boats going slower
than sound, it turns
out that using the
hot air to power big
blowers takes less fire
water than using the
air itself as a pusher.

FIRE-WATER CARRIERS

SPIN STOPPERS
The blowers that push the air
together all work by spinning,
but since they’re all spinning in
the same direction, they can start
the air spinning around instead of
going toward the burning room.
To keep that from happening,
there are little wings in between
each blower to make the river of
air go straight and keep it from
turning too much.

POWER MAKER
This machine uses
the turning stick to
make a little extra
power for the rest of
the sky boat to use
(for things like lights
and computers).

These carry fire water into
the burning room.

AIR GETTER
The air up high is too thin to breathe.
This thing grabs some of the air that
the blowers pushed together and
sends it to the inside of the sky boat
so people can breathe.

BACK PUSHER
If the sky boat needs to stop, it can use
these doors to send the air out the sides
and toward the front, which makes it
push back instead of forward.

STUFF YOU TOUCH TO FLY A SKY BOAT
Most of the lights and
keys are simple; they
just do one thing, like
turn a light on and off.
Some of the big rows
of keys and screens between the seats are for
sending messages to people or looking at maps and
making plans.

A sky boat has a room
in front with two chairs.
Drivers sit in them and
tell the boat where to go.
The room has some
windows, but most of it
is taken up by screens,
keys, and little lights that
change color to tell you
how each part of the boat
is feeling.

The hardest parts of ﬂying
are taking off and landing.
The middle part of the trip
is easier. During the middle
part, the computer often does
all the ﬂying, and the drivers
are just there to watch over
it and make sure there are no
problems.

Sky boats have computers in
them, and the computer can
ﬂy pretty well, if it has a plan
for where to go. A lot of the
keys and screens are for asking the boat what its plans are,
and giving it new ones if you
don’t like what it says.

really mad at you.

BIG TINY THING HITTER
Tiny thing hitters are machines that hit tiny
things together really hard. To explain why
anyone would want to do that, it might help
to imagine a story about boats.
Say you and some friends are on a boat
moving over a sea. The sea is covered in
clouds, so you don’t know what it’s like. You
think there’s water—but what’s in the water?
Is there ice? Big biting ﬁsh? Or is it really a
sea of beer instead of water? Or sand, or
plastic balls?
To ﬁgure out what’s in the sea, you could
throw things over the edge and see what

BIG TINY THING
HITTER

ﬂies back up. If you throw something heavy,
a few drops of water might ﬂy up. If you
throw something down harder, the wave
might toss a piece of ice into the air. You can
learn a lot this way!
Now, imagine that you notice that your boat
is moving. You don’t have any wind sheets,
so you wonder what’s pushing you along.
You and your friends also notice that you
sometimes hear strange sounds against
the side of the boat. After thinking it over,
you and your friends decide that maybe
the boat is being pushed by big biting ﬁsh

hitting the side. So you get an idea: If you
throw something heavy enough into the sea,
one of them will throw up a big ball of water
with a biting ﬁsh in it.
But to have a chance of lifting a ﬁsh into
view, you need to build something that can
hit the water really hard. Doing that will take
a lot of work (and money), but you and your
friends think that if it can get answers about
what’s going on in the water, maybe you
should give it a shot.

This machine works by throwing pieces of air down a
hallway so they hit together really hard. The air hits with
so much power that the pieces break in strange new ways,
as if it shakes the air—and space itself—so hard that things
fall out.

get going fast.

These hitters use a kind of air that can be pushed by
a force from power lines, or by the kind of pulling
metal used to stick pictures to a kitchen cold box.
Turners are built that push the air with that force.

From the first hallway, the air gets
sent into these hallways that go in
a circle. While it’s going around,
they push it faster and faster.

This is shown deeper than it really is, to make
it easier to see. It’s really only about as deep as
a tall building, but as big around as a large city.

as fast as light.

HALLWAYS
The air flies through these hallways, one in each direction.
To keep the fast air from hitting other air and slowing down,
the hallways have all the air taken out before they start the
machine. The hallways of this machine are emptier than any
other place near any of the worlds around the Sun.

TURNERS
This machine makes the
force that keeps the air
in the middle of the
hallway and pushes
it around the circle.
It works by running
power through
very, very cold
metal. Cold metal
lets power run
through it very
fast, and that
power makes a
force that pushes
hard on the air.

WHY IT’S SO BIG
The hallway is very big; it would take you all day to walk
around it. It has to be big because the air is going so fast
that if they made it any smaller, they wouldn’t be able to
make it turn fast enough to stay in the hallway. Then the
air would hit the wall and make things blow up.

The flying air carries a lot of
power. If they have to turn
off the machine, and
there’s no time to
let the air slow
down, they
send it into
this huge rock
room. The air hits the
rock and heats it up, but
doesn’t hurt anything else.

AN AIR POCKET POOL

HITTING ROOMS
There are rooms around the hallway where people can make
the air going one way hit the air going the other way. When it
hits, machines in these rooms watch what flies out.

AIR POCKETS AND CLOUDS
In this machine, people watch for flying pieces using sheets of
computer-controlled feelers. In older machines, though, they
used some stranger things, like air pocket pools and cloud boxes.
Air pocket pools are big pools of really hot water, right on the
edge of turning to air. When a tiny piece flies through the pool,
it makes tiny pockets of water turn to air and start to grow. Each
thing that goes through leaves a track of air pockets behind it,
and they make beautiful pictures.
Cloud boxes are like air pocket pools, except instead of water
right on the edge of turning to air, they use air right on the edge
of turning to water. When things fly through, they leave a line of
water drops in the air.

These lines are the paths of
tiny things flying through water.
Some of them go in circles
because there’s a pushing field
that makes the flying pieces
turn. Seeing how much they
turn helps tell us what they are.

You can build one of these cloud boxes in your house, and see
lines left by tiny things from space! (Or from heavy metal, if you
have any, which you probably shouldn’t.)

COOLING AIR
The outside of this
carrier has a layer of
air so cold it turns to
water. (They use the
kind of air you can
breathe in to make
your voice sound
funny.)

LIGHT THROUGH THE EARTH
By hitting pieces together, this hitter makes
many strange things. One of the things it
makes is kind of like light, except it goes right
through almost anything without touching it.
There’s a building in another part of the world
where they have machines to look at this light
and learn about it.
To send the light to the building, they just point
it there—right through the Earth. It’s so good at
going through stuff, it barely notices the Earth.

POWER BOXES
It’s hard to understand how power boxes
work, because they’re full of water and
metal doing things that are too small to see.
Ideas from our normal lives don’t really help
us to think about what they’re doing.

To try to explain how they work, we have to
make up new ideas. These ideas aren’t real—
we can’t see the “real” things—but the ideas
can explain an important idea about how
they work.

A lot of learning we do works this way. The
ideas on this page are pretty far away from
“real,” but they should help explain part of
how power boxes work.
CARRIER MAKER

IDEAS FOR THINKING ABOUT POWER BOXES

PIECE OF POWER

A power box has two sides, one holding a carrier wanter
and the other holding a carrier maker. Between them is
a wall that lets carriers through. The carrier maker would
make carriers that cover the carrier wanter. But eating
carriers puts pieces of power in the carrier wanter, and
you can’t have too many pieces of power together,
because they push each other away. This stops the
carrier wanter from eating too many carriers.

POWER CARRIER

This metal wants to get rid of carriers. If it
gets a piece of power inside it, it will send
it away in a carrier made from its surface.

POWER

CARRIER WANTER

(in power carrier)

This metal wants to be covered in carriers.
It will grab them if they come near and
stick them to its surface, and the power
from the carrier will go inside them.

The two sides of a power box have a
wall between them. This wall lets carriers
through, but not pieces of power. It also
stops the carrier wanter and carrier maker
from touching, which would make the
carriers all move to the carrier wanter
without sending any power anywhere.

When you join the two sides with a stick of
metal, the pieces of power can get from the
carrier wanter to the carrier maker.

After a while, the carrier wanter gets
covered in empty carriers, and the carrier
maker gets used up. There’s nothing left to
push the power pieces through the metal
path; the power box is dead.

Extra pieces of power gather in the carrier
wanter, but they can’t go anywhere at first.

When the pieces of power get to the carrier
maker, it uses them to make new carriers.

If you put a machine in their way—like a light
or a power spinner—they can push on it
and make it run, just like water pushing on a
water wheel.

With some power boxes, you can turn the
wheel and push power back into the power
box. This fills the power box back up.

SMALL POWER BOX
This kind of power box is used in a lot of places. It powers hand lights, face hair
cutters, and things kids play with.
In this kind of power box, the carrier wanter and carrier maker are made from
different kinds of metal. The stuff in between is water with a kind of white stuff
in it which lets the carriers move across. If the power box breaks, that stuff can
come out. Don’t worry, it’s safe to clean up; it won’t hurt your skin.
All power boxes run out of power after a while. With some kinds, you can put
power back in and use them again and again, but you can’t really do that with
the kind shown here.

box can start making a kind of air.
There’s a hole here to let that air out
so the box doesn’t pop.

YOU CAN DROP THESE TO SEE IF THEY’RE DEAD
The carrier wanter in these boxes is made from metal dust. When it gets
covered in carriers, it becomes stronger and sticks together, so the dust can’t
move around. This makes dead power boxes fly back up when you drop them,
but full ones just hit the ground and stop.

HAND COMPUTER POWER BOX
These power boxes hold more power
for their size than any other. We first
made them to power helper machines in
people’s chests. Those machines need to
hold a lot of power, since people don’t like
it if you take them out too often.
When we started making lots of hand
computers, we got better at making these
power boxes, since lots of people wanted
their computers to work all day without
having to get power from the wall.
Of course, people also wanted their hearts
to work, but more people have hand
computers than heart boxes.

If you cut one of these open,
it would look like this—but
never cut these open. They
can blow up.

LIGHT METAL
In these power boxes, the carrier
wanter and carrier maker are both
made of very light metals. To make
this kind of carrier maker and
wanter work together, they’re laid
down in sheets almost touching
each other, like two long sheets of
paper laid flat and then rolled up.

they both turn into
the same kind of
metal.

HOLE-MAKING CITY BOAT
Deep in the Earth, there are pools full of the
ﬁre water and ﬁre air that power cars and
sky boats. Some of these pools are under
land, and we’ve worked hard to get the ﬁre
water from them.
Many of the pools are under the sea ﬂoor.
It’s harder to reach these pools, but since
you can sell the stuff in them for so much
money, people have built big city boats all
around the world to try anyway.

It’s easy to get hurt working on a city boat.
Big machines are moving heavy pieces of
metal around all the time, and people work
high above the water. And, of course, the
whole point of the city being there is to
gather stuff that burns well, so sometimes
cities catch ﬁre.

FIRE WATER GETTERS

ROCK-EATING STICK MACHINE
CITY BOATS

We push this stick into the ground, and
wheels at the front covered in teeth

and push it back up the hole.

Sometimes these cities sit on top of the
water like normal boats, but some of them
stand on the bottom on legs the size of tall
buildings.

These things get the fire water
either by pulling it up with a metal

straight from the Sun’s light—like trees, and
some things that grow in the sea. Most living things that don’t eat the Sun’s light eat
other living things to get their power. In the
end, the power comes from the Sun.
When things die, some of that power is left
in their remains, which is why you can get
power out of dead trees by burning them.
Sometimes, if dead things don’t burn or get
eaten, they go into the ground with that

power still inside them. Over a long time, under the weight and heat of the Earth, huge
numbers of these remains can change into
different kinds of rocks, water, or air . . . but
even as they change, they hold on to their
power. When we ﬁnd these remains, we can
burn them, and get all that power—gathered
from the Sun over huge stretches of time—
at once.
When we ﬁrst built machines powered by
ﬁre, we burned wood from the forests of
our time. When those weren’t enough, we
started burning the forests of the past.

HOW WE GET BLACK ROCKS OUT OF THE GROUND
If the rocks aren’t very
deep, we can make
holes under the ground
and carry them up with
machines. This is how
we used to get most of
the rocks we burned.

One day, those will run out, too, and we’ll
have to get power somewhere new—like
straight from the Sun, or the Earth’s heat.
But we may have to change the kind of
power we use soon, before we ﬁnish burning
all the stuff in the ground. It turns out burning that stuff is changing our air, in a way
that’s making the world hotter. If we use up
all the black rocks, ﬁre water, and ﬁre air, the
problem it makes may be too big for us.

HOW WE GET FIRE WATER AND
FIRE AIR OUT OF THE GROUND

As we built bigger
earth-moving machines,
we learned to just move
all the trees and land
out of the way to get
the rocks.
Some rocks are inside
mountains, so some
companies have started
blowing up the tops of
the mountains so they
can get the rocks out
more easily.
This kind of work leaves pools full of heavy metals and strange kinds of water that was used to
get the black rocks out. Sometimes you can notice the bright colors of these pools from the air.
When companies are done making holes, they often leave the pools behind. People worry about
whether the stuff in the pools could be bad for us. Sometimes birds land in the pools and die.

FIRE AIR
FIRE WATER

Over time, some dead
things slowly turn to fire
water and fire air.
These are both lighter than rocks, and
rise up through tiny holes. When they
reach a rock with no holes, they form
pools, with the lighter air on top.

We make holes
looking for places
where lots of things
died. When we find
a pool, we push a
stick down and pull
up all the fire air and
fire water.

HOLES
BLACK
ROCKS
One reason we make
holes that bend is
so we can reach
under cities without
bothering people.

HOW DEEP?
We can only get black rocks
easily if they’re not too deep in
the ground. The biggest problem
is that deeper in the Earth, rocks
are hotter. It’s hard to get a lot of
rock up out of the ground, and if
the rocks are too hot, that makes
everything so hard that it’s not
worth it.
There are other problems. You
need to cut big rooms into the
ground to get black rocks out,
and it’s hard to hold the roof up
when there’s so much rock piled
up on it. Sometimes the roof falls
and people die.

WHITE STUFF
This is white stuff, like what
we put on food to make it better
(although we mostly get the
kind we eat from drying out sea
water). We make holes like this
to get white stuff out, then we
put it on our roads to get rid of
snow and ice.

HOLES

We sometimes use the spaces
we leave behind to hold stuff,
like fire water or fire air that we
want to save to burn later.

STRANGE SHAPE
When a sea dries up, it leaves lots of
this white stuff behind. Sometimes, the
stuff gets covered in dirt and sand.
When the layers above the white stuff
get heavier, it can make the white stuff
start to rise up and push through the
layers above. It looks like paint drops
falling from a ceiling, but going up.

DEEP POOLS
We can get fire water and fire air from
much deeper places than we can get black
rocks. Since it forms pools and can run
through small holes easily, we only need to
make a very thin hole to get it out, instead
of having to move all the rocks around it.

FIRE
WATER

ROCK BREAKING
Big, easy-to-reach pools of fire water are getting harder to find, so we’ve been trying new
ideas for getting it from the ground. We’ve found that sometimes, rock has fire water or air
you can burn stuck in it. To get it out, we push water into the ground so hard that it makes
the rocks break. Then we push in small rocks or glass to hold the breaks open, and the fire
water and fire air comes out through the openings.
Making all these holes in the rock might mean that when we drink water, we’ll also drink
whatever stuff they use to get fire water out, since everything can run through the new
holes in the rock.

HOLES

TALL ROADS
The Earth’s pull holds people to the ground.
We like to walk around, but sometimes the
ground goes places we don’t want to go,
like under a river or into a deep hole. We
can’t get past those places because we have

to follow the ground. (Birds don’t, since they
can ﬂy by pushing on the air. Someone in a
movie once sang, “If birds ﬂy over the sky,
why can’t I?” The answer is, “You are too big
and don’t have wings.”)

ROAD

If we want to go somewhere, we can make
a road that goes straight across, high above
the ground. Making short roads over holes
and rivers is pretty easy, but making long
ones can be very hard.

LONGER ROAD

LONG ROAD

If the hole is small enough, you
can put a board over the hole
to make a new road. Then you
can walk across the board.

If you find a bigger hole, you can try
to find a bigger board. Bigger boards
are longer and stronger, but they’re
also heavier—and bigger things get
heavier faster than they get stronger.

All boards bend a little, and longer
boards bend more. A long enough board
will break under your weight, and a very
long board will break under its own.

BENDY ROAD

TALL ROAD

THICK ROAD
You can cross a larger hole with a road that’s
allowed to bend. If you tie many small boards
together and let it hang, bending won’t hurt it,
and that will let it hold more weight.

You can cross a bigger hole if you
make the board thicker. Thicker
things are harder to bend, so this
kind of road is stronger.

This kind of road gets stronger the more you
let it hang down, but it also gets harder to walk
across. If it hangs down too far, it’s no better
than just walking down into the hole.

It might seem like it would make more
sense to put the extra-thick part below the
road, because it’s “holding” the road up,
and we usually hold things from below.
But if it’s strong mostly because it’s thick,
then it works just as well if you add the
thickness above the road.

ROAD HANGING UNDER
A STRONGER SHAPE

ROAD HANGING FROM STICKS

HANGING ROAD
PROBLEMS
Since all this stuff you’re adding is just there to hold
the road up, that stuff doesn’t need to be near the
road. You can make a strong metal piece that goes
high up over the hole—which gives it a stronger
shape, but would be harder to walk on if the road
went that way—and then use strong metal lines to
hang the road straighter across under it.

When you hold up a road by
hanging it, you have to be very
careful. These tall roads keep
the road from being moved by
the Earth’s pull—which is always
straight down—but wind can
make the road swing side-to-side.

Another way to hold up a road is to build very strong
sticks, then hang the road from the top ends of the
sticks. The lines need to be a little stronger than the
lines in the other hanging road, and the sticks need to
be really strong. On the other hand, there are only two
sticks, so that can make building easier.

Some roads have fallen down
because the builders didn’t
understand wind well enough.

VERY TALL ROAD

THIS IS THE BEST KIND OF TALL ROAD.
That’s not really true. Different tall roads are good for different things.
But a lot of the time, when you need to cross a big hole, this kind of
shape will let your road reach farther than any other shape would.

TALL ROADS ON OTHER WORLDS
A very bright person (who was known for calling
the Earth a “pale blue point”) once said something
interesting about these kinds of roads in one of his
books.
He pointed out that everything about the shape of
very tall roads is decided by the laws of space and
time—the laws that say how a world’s weight pulls
things—and those laws are the same everywhere.
That means that if there’s life on other worlds, the

road shape that works best for them should be the
same one that works best for us. Our tall roads may
look familiar to them.
Maybe that’s true; maybe it’s not. We don’t know if
there’s life on other worlds, and if there is, maybe
they don’t build roads at all. Maybe their way of
living is different from ours in ways we can’t even
think about.
But if they have holes they need to get across . . .
. . . and if, in their world, they build things out of
different shapes, like us . . .

. . . and if they have problems with holding their
roads up . . .
. . . then they very well may build tall roads that look
just like ours.
I like that idea, because now, when I look at one
of these tall roads, I always feel a little happier. It
makes me think about how maybe, somewhere far
across space and time, there’s someone looking
at another tall road, thinking about how the shape
might be found across many worlds, and—maybe—
wondering about me.

steps that are written down as

Following steps might not be
“thinking.” But it’s hard to say

things where not only do we
not know the answer, we’re
not sure what the question is.

Power runs through them,
and they keep it from
changing too quickly. This
way, if there are any little
jumps or stops in the power,
it doesn’t break things.

Most computers can now
remember that stuff even

they don’t need an extra

DARK WORLDS
Out past the cold wind world, there
are lots of little ice worlds moving
very slowly around the far-away Sun.

BIG WORLD BOAT
This boat visited the big world and its
moons. Once it was done with its job, we
told it to fly into the huge air world so
it would burn up in the air, just like old
space boats sometimes do on Earth.

BIG TRIP TAKER ONE

BIG TRIP TAKER TWO

We were so surprised when an earlier
boat saw clouds around the cloud
moon, we told Big Trip Taker One to
change plans and fly past the cloud
moon for a closer look. This took it
off the road to the other worlds, and
it headed out into space. It’s now
traveled farther from home than
anything humans have built.

Big Trip Taker Two is the only boat
to visit the two outer worlds.

These two air worlds are smaller than
the ring world and the huge air world.
They have more kinds of water in their
air, which makes them more blue.

We did that because we were worried
that if we didn’t, it would hit one of the
other worlds and spread Earth’s tiny
animals there. We don’t know if there are
any other animals on those worlds, but if
there are, we don’t want our animals to
eat them before we can look at them.

OLD CIRCLECOVERED MOON

This world is far from the
Sun. It has the coldest air
and the fastest winds.

LOST WORLD
This world is strange because
it used to go around the Sun
alone, but one day it came too
close to the cold wind world
and now it lives there.

RING WORLD
These two worlds are huge
balls of air and water with
some rocks in the middle.

This moon got hit by lots
of rocks once, which left it
covered in circle-shaped
holes, just like our Moon.

All the big air
worlds have thin
rings, but this
world’s are huge
and bright.

RING WORLD BOAT
This boat visited the ring world to
learn more about it—and to get a
closer look at the cloud moon.

BIG MOON
This is the
biggest and
heaviest moon
near the Sun.

CLOUD MOON
BIG WORLD
This is the biggest
world around the
Sun. It’s mostly made
of air. Some of its
moons are almost as
big as our world.

ICE WATER MOON
This world has ice on the outside,
but it’s warmer on the inside, and
there’s water under the ice.
Since there’s warm water, lots of
people want to go there to look for
animals. We don’t know if there are
animals there, but if there are, we
want to know about them.

This world is very strange—it’s the only
moon covered in thick clouds. The air
there is even thicker than Earth’s.
It would be nice if it were the kind of
air we can breathe, but it’s not.

SMELLY YELLOW MOON
This world has lots of color, but the color
doesn’t look very nice. It looks kind of like
fire, but even more like food that came out
of someone’s mouth. It’s covered in stuff
that smells like old food.

SPECIAL ENGINE BOAT

THE MOON

This boat visited two of the little worlds between
the red world and the huge world. It’s pushed by
a special engine that’s powered by the Sun.

Other moons have names, but our moon is just
called the Moon. Some people visited it once.

It was the first boat to visit two different worlds
and stay for a while at each of them.

We’re not sure where it came from. We think
another world probably hit our world when it
was very young and lots of pieces flew off, and
then the pieces fell together and made the new
baby world. But we don’t know for sure yet.

HOT SKY WORLD
This world is about as big as our world,
but it’s much hotter. One reason it’s hot
is that it’s closer to the Sun. The other
reason is that it has more air than our
world, which keeps it warm, sort of like a
thick coat around the whole world.
People used to think this world would be
nice to live on. But if you visit this world,
you will have lots of problems.
The air is really hot. If you land there,
you will be on fire, and you will not come
home. The air is really heavy. If you land
there, it will be like you’re deep under the
sea. The sky will press down on you and
make you get smaller, and you will not
come home. The air isn’t the kind of air
humans breathe. If you try to breathe it,
you will not come home. The air is also full
of a kind of water that’s bad for your skin.
If it touches you, you might come home,
but without your skin.

This world is hard to see because
it’s right next to the bright Sun. It
turns very slowly, so the day side
gets very hot and the night side

THE SUN
The Sun is a star. It looks bigger and
brighter than other stars because it’s much
closer to us. But it turns out it really is
bigger and brighter than other stars.
For a while, we thought it was smaller than
other stars, because most of the stars we
looked at turned out to be bigger than it.
But it turns out there are lots of stars that
are less bright; they’re just harder to see.

WORLDS AROUND THE SUN
The Sun is the biggest thing near us. Our
world and everything near it goes around
the Sun. Some of the worlds that go around
the Sun are big enough that they have their
own moons—little worlds that go around
them as they all go around the Sun.

PICTURE TAKER
When you look at something, the light from
it goes into your eye and makes a picture
inside your head. The picture gives you an
idea about the thing’s shape and color.

Since before humans learned to write, we’ve
been using painting to turn our ideas back
into pictures. Pictures let us remember the
things we saw and ideas we had, and to put
those ideas in other people’s heads, too.

A few hundred years ago, we started making machines that turned light straight into
pictures. These made it easier for anyone to
make pictures, and picture making has become a big part of how we talk and share.

LIGHT PAPER
Some kinds of paper change color when light hits them. Picture takers used these for a long time.
This paper alone isn’t enough to make a picture, though. When you hold the paper up to
someone, light from every part of them hits every part of the paper, so your whole page will be
all one color. (Unless you hold the paper so close to the thing that each part of the paper only
sees light from one part of the thing, but that doesn’t work very well.)

SHAPE

MORE LIGHT

BENDING LIGHT

SPECIAL SHAPES

To make a picture of something,
you need to control the light so that
each part of the paper sees light
from just one part of it.

The hole idea works, but a tiny hole
doesn’t let very much light through,
so it takes a long time for enough
light to hit the paper to make a
picture.

To make the picture less
clouded, we need to bend
lots of light from each part of
the thing toward the spot on
the picture that goes with it.

By cutting glass into the right shapes, we can make light
benders that catch lots of light and send the light from
each direction to a different part of the picture.

One way to do this is by blocking
almost all the light paths using a
wall with a hole in it. (This makes a
picture that’s turned over, but that’s
okay—you can just turn it back.)

To let in more light, you could make
We can do this by using
the hole bigger, but then the light
things that bend light—like

the paper, clouding the picture.

This machine is good enough to take a simple picture,
but it will be a little clouded and not very sharp or bright.
To take a clearer picture, we have to add more benders
to control the path the light takes more carefully.

BIG PICTURE TAKER
This machine is used to take sharp pictures,
even of things that are small or far away.
Our eyes are better than most picture takers at
seeing small and far-away things, but thanks to
its very large benders that take in lots of light,
this kind of picture taker can see even better.

LOOKER
The whole front end
of the picture taker
is for gathering light.
The whole thing can
come off, so you can
use different lookers
for different kinds of
pictures.

PICTURE
WINDOW

Most picture takers
use glass, since
it’s easier to cut
it into a shape
than water. Some
people are trying
to build computercontrolled benders
that use water, which would let the
benders change shape to control the
light without using as many parts.

WHY ARE THERE SO MANY BENDERS?

POWER BOX

MEMORY

These light benders are here for different reasons, but one of the big
ones is that some colors of light bend more than others when they go
through glass. This can make some colors in a picture sharp while others
are spread out. Different kinds of glass break up colors
in different ways, so by sending the light through one
kind of glass and then another, groups of benders can
get the different colors to the same place.

Taking pictures can
use lots of power,
so picture takers
usually need special
power boxes.

This holds
the pictures
you take.

LIGHT CATCHER
This used to be made of
paper, but on computer
picture takers like this
one, it’s a flat sheet of
computer light feelers.
Each one checks how
much light is hitting it,
then tells the computer.
The computer puts the
messages together to
make a picture.

This window opens and closes to let light through to the light catcher
and take a picture. It has two sheets. When it starts taking a picture, the
bottom sheet pulls down out of the way. When it’s done gathering light,
the top screen comes down to cover it. It uses two screens; if it used a
screen that came up and then pulled back, then the top half of the light
catcher would spend more time catching light than the bottom.

SCREEN
This screen shows you
what the light catcher
is seeing. It also lets
you look at the pictures
you took and decide
whether you want to
keep them.

LIGHT
COMES
IN HERE

Some picture takers
have a hole you can
look through, too, which
shows you a view out
the looker using a mirror
(or pretends to, using
another screen).

FLASH
If there’s not enough
light to make a good
picture, this can light up
the area for a moment
while the picture
window is open. The
light can make the
shadows in a picture
look strange, though, so
some people try not to
use it very much.

FRONT BENDERS CLOSE-OR-FAR BENDERS

PICTURE BENDERS

NO MIRROR

CHANGING SHAPE

These grab all
the light and start
bringing it together
so the other benders
can do things with it.

These light benders are
the ones that bring the
light together to make
a picture on the light
catcher in the back.

Nice picture takers used
to have a mirror here, so
you could look through
a hole in the top and
see through the looker,
to see what would be
in the picture. The loud
“picture-taking sound”
is the mirror moving out
of the way to let light
reach the back.

Picture takers have changed
shape over time. The back
parts are smaller, but some of
the front parts of good picture
takers have stayed big. The
jobs done by the back parts,
like saving pictures and
storing power, are now being
done by small computers. The
front parts bend light, and
computers can’t do that yet.

Now, more and more
picture takers are using
screens to show you
the view instead.

Soon, people might just use
their hand computers as the
back part, sticking them to a
looker to take nice pictures.

These benders control how close up
or far away the things in the picture
look. They slide forward to look at
small things far away, and back to
see a wider view of the whole area.

DUST SHAKER WINDOW
Even a tiny piece of dust stuck to the picture window can make
the machine take bad pictures. In small picture takers, the
picture window is locked inside and safe from dust. But on ones
where you can take the big looker off to put on a different one,
dust can get in.
To keep dust from being a problem, there’s a window in front of
the picture window with a shaker on it. The shaker shakes the
window very fast, throwing off any dust that sticks to it.

WRITING STICKS
People used to write all their words using
sticks. Now, they write words by pressing keys, which is usually a lot faster. Even
though we’re writing more words every day
than we used to, we’re using writing sticks
less and less.

Some people still use sticks like these for
things other than writing. People who draw
pictures for a living might not use paper
anymore, but most of them still use sticks to
control where lines go.

(The pictures in this book weren’t drawn on
paper, but they were still drawn with a stick.)
Someday, we may stop using sticks for making pictures, too.

PROBLEM FIXER
This used to be made
from tree blood, but
now it’s usually made
from a kind of plastic
(which is made from
very old dead things).

SOUND

WOOD PART

It makes a loud sound
when you do this, and
some people press it over
and over again.

Most of the wood for
most writing sticks
comes from one kind
of tree. Writing-stick
makers like that tree
because the wood smells
nice and doesn’t break
off into little pieces that
get stuck in your hand.

They don’t always think
about the sound when
they’re doing this, but the
people around them do.

It turns out a lot of the
parts of writing sticks
come from dead things.

POINTS
This kind of writing stick
gets less pointy as you
use it, so you have to
keep cutting it to make a
new point.

HOW THE END THING
YOU PRESS WORKS
If the bottom end of the
writing stick, where the
writing water comes out,
is inside the stick, pressing
the top end makes it go out.
If it’s out, pressing again
makes it come back in.
The writing stick does this
by using several strangely
shaped parts that all push
on each other in different
ways, and it’s hard to
understand even when you
can see it happening.

Now—like almost every
other part of these
sticks—writing water is
often made from black
rocks and fire water,
which are themselves
made from long-ago
dead trees and sea life.
Some writing water, like
the kind used to write
news on paper each
day,* is made from a kind
of food we grow (it’s a
kind of food people use
to make pretend animal
parts to eat instead of
real ones).
*If you’re reading this in the future, this is
a thing we used to do.

It’s a very cool idea.

YELLOW PAINT

ANIMAL WE
GOT WRITING
WATER FROM

Although we haven’t used
heavy metal in the writing
part in the center for
hundreds of years, until not
too long ago, we did use it
to make the yellow paint
on the outside.

HUMAN

We finally learned how
bad that metal was and
stopped using it for yellow
paint, so now you probably
won’t get sick from biting
your writing stick.
Empty space
where you can
hide a piece
of paper if you
want to send
someone a note

Sometimes you get a
nice sharp point, but
sometimes it’s hard to
get right:

BALL MADE OF VERY,
VERY HARD METAL
PUSHER

When this happens, it
can make you decide
the thing you were
writing wasn’t very
important after all.

WRITING WATER
This is the stuff that goes
on the page. We used to
get it from sea animals
that have many arms.

You push down on this
part to make the end of
the writing stick come out.

WRITING PART
This used to be made
from a kind of heavy
metal, long ago, but now
it’s made from black
rocks that we found
in the ground. Most of
those rocks come from
very old dead things.

If you write something wrong
with these, it will always be
wrong. (Unless you write over
it with the same color as the
paper, so it’s hidden.)

This is made of plastic,
like most of the parts of
this writing stick. If you
take this off, the writing
water won’t fall out, but
it will make the writing
stick look less nice.

This is the bottom end,
where the writing water
comes out slowly.
Sometimes it comes out
very fast, and colors your
clothes. Then you have to
buy new clothes, unless
you like the new colors.

The ball at the bottom
end rolls around as the
writing stick moves over
the paper.

When the ball dries
out, you have to
move it around for a
while before it gets
covered with writing
water again.

The top side of the ball
gets covered with writing
water, and then it rolls over
and leaves the water on
the paper.

HAND COMPUTER
These machines began as radios for talking
out loud to people who were far away. Over
the years, they slowly became more and
more like computers.

As these machines turned into computers,
they started taking the place of a lot of
things we used to carry around—like picture
takers, music players, and even books.

This turns the screen off if
your head is near it, so you

This lets the hand

your house, instead of the
big radio run by the phone
company, which can save
you money.

This piece of metal turns very
fast to make the phone move.
That way, it can get your
attention without making too
much noise. (Unless it’s sitting
on a hard table; then it can
make a lot of noise.)

EXTRA MEMORY

JOINERS

If your phone is storing too
many memories for you
(like pictures, sounds, and
games), you can put a card
here to give it more space.

Different parts of the hand
computer, like the screen and
the radio feelers, join up with
the rest of the phone here
when it gets put together.

As computers and radios
get faster, companies are
holding more and more
of your memories on
their computers, and only
sending them to you when
you ask for them.

CARD HOLDER

computer they’re talking to.

Like other computers, almost
every part of a hand computer
is full of many different kinds of
power gates.

THINKING
BOX

This tells the hand
computer how to
understand the
words the company’s
radios send.

DIRECTION FEELER

This picture is used in maps of
parts to mean “power gate”:

FAST MEMORY
This part of the phone holds
stuff the hand computer is
thinking about right now,
like pages you’re looking at
or games you’re playing.
The memory goes away
when the phone turns off.

These gates take in power from
one line, and listen to another
line to decide whether to let the
power through or not. Computer
brains are built by sticking these
gates together.

BIG SOUND MAKER

There are as many power gates
in a computer as there are people
on Earth. Some of them are big
and easy to see, but most of
them are tiny and control very
little power. The gates, I mean,
not the people.

This thing makes noise that
you can hear even when
your ear is far away from the
phone.

LISTENING BOX

RADIO FEELER
This part listens to the thin
pieces of metal along the
outside of the hand computer.
When a radio message comes
in, it makes power move in
the metal. This thing listens
to how the power is changing
and turns it into words.
It also listens to words that
the hand computer wants to
send back out, and turns them
into power changes to send
down the metal.

POWER HOLE

This is a special thinking box
that just listens for words.
Since it only does one thing,
it can do it without as much
power as the main thinking
box would need. If a phone
has this, you can make it
listen for your voice all the
time, not just when you
press a key.

POWER CONTROLLER
This thing pays attention to
what different parts of the
computer are doing, and
makes sure each part gets
sent the power it needs.

COLORS OF LIGHT
Light is made up of waves, and we see longer waves and shorter waves as different colors. When it rains, the Sun’s light hits tiny
drops of water and bends as it goes through
them. Some colors of light bend more than
others, so different colors reach your eye
from different parts of the sky.
These sky colors are sorted by how long
their waves are, from the shortest waves,
blue, to the longest waves, red. But the
kinds of light don’t stop there! Those are
just the shortest and longest waves that our
eyes can see.
HOW LONG
ARE THESE
WAVES?

A big country

This picture shows what other colors you
would see if the rain colors kept going. (The
picture isn’t in color, but that’s okay—they’re
not real colors, anyway!)
In real life, even if you could see longer and
shorter light waves, you wouldn’t see these
colors spread out like this in the sky. There
are three reasons for this.
First, the Sun gives off most of its light in
colors that we can see, and light that’s a little shorter or longer. In colors that are much
shorter or longer, the Sun is pretty dark!

CAN THEY REACH
US FROM SPACE?
POWER WAVES

LONG
WAVES

When you stick the end of something into the wall
to power it, the power comes out in waves.
They’re very long, slow waves, taking so long to
change that our power lines aren’t long enough to
hold the “high” part of the wave and the “low” part
at the same time. It might make more sense to say
that the power turns on for a while, then turns off.
Light “turns on and off” too fast to count, but
power waves only turn on and off a few dozen
times each second.

A city

A building

Third, the colors are sorted from long to
short because short waves (blue) bend
more than long waves (red). But there are
some colors, kinds we can’t see, where it
goes the other way! That means that these
colors wouldn’t be spread out like they’re
shown here; they’d be laid in sheets over
themselves—some parts top to bottom and
other parts bottom to top—all in the same
area of the sky.

WHAT ARE THEY?

A small country

A small town

Second, lots of these kinds of light don’t go
through water, so they wouldn’t go through
the rain.

RADIO
OLD RADIO

Radio waves and light are the
same stuff. Radio is just longer.
Our eyes can’t see light that long,
but we can build machines that
can.

This side shows which kinds of
light can get through Earth’s air.

These long waves go
through normal air, but
can’t get through a special
layer of air near the edge of
space. The air in that layer
acts kind of like a mirror for
radio, which is why you can
pick up some kinds of radio
messages from other parts
of the Earth.

WARM LIGHT
Everything gives off light because everything is at
least a little warm, and warm things give off light.
Warmer things give off more light made of shorter
waves.
Our bodies give off these colors of light because
we’re kind of warm, but not warm enough to give off
light you can see.
If you wear special computer glasses that help you
see these colors of light, you can see where people
are in the dark using the light from their bodies.

RAIN COLORS
People say those rain lights in the
sky show all the colors, but they
don’t really; there’s no deep pink.
The more you learn about color,
the more you find that almost
everything people say about
color is only sort of true.

BLACK LIGHT
This is the kind of light that burns
your skin if you stay out in the Sun.

Sometimes, tiny rocks—going almost as fast as light—

us safe from that, too.

LIGHT WE CAN SEE
A small thing
that takes over
your body’s
bags of water

These radio waves go through air just
fine. We use them for looking at stars
and talking to our space boats.

These very “short” colors
of light aren’t really like
waves at all. They’re
more like tiny rocks
going very fast.
Not very many things
make this kind of light.

If any of these hit you, they could break down the
things in your bags of water that tell your body how to
grow. If you got enough of them, it could make your
body start growing wrong.
When people go into space, where there’s no air to
stop these things, they sometimes see little flashes of
light as the things from space hit their eyes.
That’s one reason we don’t let people stay in space too
long—if they stay too long, their bodies might get hit in
enough places that they start growing wrong.

The Sun gives off light in these
colors. The colors our eyes can
see are right in the middle of
that, which makes sense; eyes
grew to fit the Sun’s light.

These kinds
of light can’t
get through
air.

A special layer
stops some of the
light that burns
your skin. A while
back, we learned
that we had made
a hole in that layer.
We didn’t mean to.
We’re fixing it.

FAR-AWAY FLASHES
About once every day, our
space boats see flashes
of very, very high-power
light from somewhere far
off in space.
We’re pretty sure they
come from huge stars
dying, but we aren’t sure
exactly what happens in
the stars to make the light.

THINK ABOUT HOW DEEP
THE SKY IS
The stars look like they’re
painted on a roof, but they’re
really more like pieces of
dust moving through a black
sea. The white clouds are just
lots of stars stretching off
into the distance.
PUT WARM THINGS OVER
PEOPLE
It’s cold at night, even in the
summer! Bring warm things
and food.

The stars in this half of the sky are named after newer things, because these are the names given to
the stars by people from the north half of the world when they visited the south half for the first time.
They didn’t ask the people who lived in the south half whether the stars already had names.
People who learn about space now mostly use the new names picked by the people from the north.

THE PIECES EVERYTHING IS MADE OF
People used to think that everything
around us was built from four kinds of stuff:
earth, air, ﬁre, and water. They were almost
right—but instead of four kinds of pieces,
there are more like ten dozen.

All the things we can touch (but not things
like light) are made from these pieces.
There are almost ten dozen that we’ve
found so far, but there are probably more.

Here are a few of the things
these pieces are named after.

PIECES OF PIECES

CENTER NUMBER

These things are called “metals,” but
a lot of them are more like rocks or
dust. They often burn easily.

These pieces are made
of even smaller pieces.
Different kinds of pieces
have different numbers
of those smaller parts.
There are three main
kinds of these smaller
parts—two heavy ones
and a light one.

We number the pieces by counting how
many of one kind of heavy part they have
in their center, and use that number to
put pieces in boxes in the table. The other
heavy part doesn’t matter to the count, so
pieces with different numbers of that part
may share the same box in the table.

QUIET AIR

The things in this area of the table do a
lot of things. When you put them near
things from the other end of the table,
they can turn to different kinds of water,
start fires, or make everything blow up.

This end of the table is
pretty quiet. When you
put these kinds of air with
other things, they usually
don’t seem to notice.

People who learn about how stars
work call everything below this line
a “metal,” which is a little strange.
But stars are mostly made of the
two things above this line, so it
also kind of makes sense that star
doctors wouldn’t care too much
about the other stuff.

We count how long a
kind of piece lasts by
timing how long it takes
for half of it to break
down. We call this the
piece’s “half-life.”

AIR, WATER, AND FIRE

People don’t agree exactly
where the line between “metals”
and “not metals” is, but it’s
somewhere around here, and
runs down and to the right.

as “metals.” Most of them are strong, hard, and look a little like mirrors.

THIS

Some kinds of pieces don’t last very long, slowly
breaking down into other pieces over time by
throwing away bits of their centers in all directions,
which makes them give off a kind of strange heat.

(The reason those groups are like
each other has to do with the number of light parts around the
outside of the piece—which is mostly the same as the piece’s
center number—and the way different numbers of light parts sort
themselves around the outside of the piece.)

The things toward the top right part of

Most of these things are very different
from each other. Many of them come in
the form of air. A few of them look like a
kind of rock or water instead of air. They
usually turn to air easily, and most of
them are not very strong.

The boxes in this table are in order

OUR STAR
The Sun is a star. It’s like other stars, but
looks brighter because it’s closer. The Sun
is so bright that we can only see other stars
when its light is blocked by the Earth.

Stars are clouds of air that fell together so
hard that they started burning. The Sun’s air
has been burning since just before the Earth
formed, and will keep burning for about that

long into the future. After the Sun runs out
of air to burn, it will get very big for a short
time, blow out lots of heat, then fall together
into a small heavy ball that slowly cools.

AIR AROUND THE SUN

HOT AIR

The Sun has air around it, like the Earth, but it
doesn’t have a hard surface under that air. It just
keeps getting thicker, all the way to the center.

The air on fire at the center of the Sun blows light
and heat out in all directions. The air in the Sun is
trying to fall toward the center, but the light and
heat keep blowing it away.

The air around the Sun is even hotter than
some of the inside parts, which is very
strange. We’re not sure why it’s like that.

Near the surface of the Sun, the air shakes
and rises and turns over, much like a cup of
water when you heat it up.

CENTER

The fire from the center of the Sun
heats the air. The air rises and turns
over, carrying heat to the surface,
where the heat is sent out to space
(most of it as light). Some of the
air is blown away too, but most
of it—cooler, thanks to its trip to
space—falls back down to heat
up again.

The middle of the Sun is where
most of the weight is gathered
and where the special fire
happens. This special fire only
starts if you push air together
very, very hard. (This is the
fire that powers our biggest
city-burning machines.)

FIRE STORMS

FIRE LIGHT

The air in the Sun makes
power as it moves (for the
same reason that a turning
wheel can make power
run through metal lines).
Sometimes, the power runs
through the Sun’s surface
and blows some of the Sun’s
fire out into space. These fire
storms carry power with them,
and if they hit Earth, they can
break our computers and power
lines.

Around the center of the
Sun, hot air doesn’t rise.
Hot air only rises when
there’s cooler air above
it, and near the center of
the Sun, all the air is hot.
Instead, the heat is carried
through the Sun by light,
just like how light carries the
Sun’s heat to your face.
The light takes a winding
path through the Sun’s air.
The path is so long that it can
take a very long time to reach
the surface—as long as hundreds
of human lives.

HOW MUCH HEAT?
Although it’s very hot, the fire doesn’t
actually make new heat very fast. An
area of air at the Sun’s center makes
about as much heat as the body of a coldblooded animal of the same size.

DARK SPOTS
Sometimes dark, cooler spots appear on
the Sun, caused by power running through
the Sun’s surface. Big fire storms often come
from places with dark spots.

Even though that doesn’t seem like a lot, the Sun is so
big—and it has such a thick coat of air around it—that the
heat adds up, making it much hotter than any animal.

To imagine how weights pull each other
together, a lot of people say to imagine them
sitting on a sheet. This doesn’t always give you
the right idea, but it works pretty well here.

Special
fire

AIR CLOUD

SPECIAL FIRE

A star begins as a cloud of air
in space. This cloud is always
moving, pushing, and feeling
waves go through it, like the
surface of the sea.

The air seems like it might keep getting
smaller and hotter like this forever. But
when it gets hot enough, a new kind of
heat is made.

After a while, a pocket of air
happens to get close enough
together that the pull of its
weight becomes stronger than
the force keeping it spread out.
As the air falls together, it
gets heavier. This makes it pull
harder, which pulls in more air.
As air falls together, it also gets
hotter. This heat is how the air
pushes back against whatever
is pushing it together.
But in this cloud, that heat isn’t
as strong as the pull of the air’s
own weight, so it keeps getting
smaller and hotter.

Heavy
center

When air is pushed together hard enough,
the pieces it’s made of can stick together.
When they do, they let out a lot of light
and heat. This is the heat that powers our
largest city-burning war machines.
When a cloud of air gets hot enough, this
kind of fire starts, and a great heat blows
out from where it burns. This hot wind is
strong enough to fight the force pulling
the air together. The air gets hotter, but
stops getting smaller. A star is born.
The force pushing away and the force
pushing in stop each other. If the star falls
a little closer together, it makes the fire
burn much hotter, pushing it back out.
A star like the Sun has enough air to
burn for a very long time—long enough
for worlds and life to form. But it can’t
burn forever.

Strange
new fires

Black
hole

The last
fire

NEW AIR
When the star burns air by
pushing it together, it makes
a new kind of heavier air. This
kind of air doesn’t burn as well,
so it gathers, not burned, in the
center of the star.
The new air’s weight pulls the
star together, making the fire
burn hotter. The wind from this
hotter fire blows the outer parts
of the star out farther. Over time,
the star grows.
When it starts running out of
air to burn, the center falls even
closer together, lighting new
kinds of fire that blow the outer
layers farther away from the star.
The star gets very, very big . . .
and as the fires begin to die, the
force holding back the star’s
weight disappears, and it starts
to fall in on itself.

THE LAST FIRE
As the dying star falls together, it becomes even
hotter than ever before. In this heat, even things that
couldn’t burn before start to burn, creating new and
strange kinds of air. (Much of the stuff we’re made of
here on Earth comes from a fire like this.)
A lot of heat and light pour out from this last fire,
and for a moment, the star can become the brightest
thing in all of space.

WHAT’S LEFT
The heat blows much of the star away into space.
Sometimes, what’s left of the star will fall together
until it becomes a bright white ball of hard air that
slowly cools. Someday, this will happen to the Sun.
If the star is bigger than the Sun, it may have too
much weight to stop even there. The weight of the
hard ball will make it keep falling in on itself, until
it becomes so strong it pulls in even light, leaving
behind a black hole in space.

THE END OF THE EARTH
When the Sun gets very big, its edge will reach the Earth, and Earth will fall in and burn
up. You don’t need to worry about that now, though. If we want to stay alive past the
Sun’s death, there are lots of other problems we’ll have to face first. Worrying about that
one now would be like worrying that one day a tree will grow where you’re standing.

HOW TO COUNT THINGS
People don’t always agree on how much
“one” is, which can cause a lot of problems.
A space boat once missed a world because
people got confused about which “one”
they should be using for weight.

To count how heavy things are, we pick a
weight to call “one.” Then, if you say a weight
is “ten,” people understand it’s as heavy as
ten “ones.” We do the same for counting
other things, like how fast or hot things are.

ROOM FOR HELPING PEOPLE
Little things go wrong in our bodies all the
time, but bodies are pretty good at fixing
problems. Parts are always breaking, but our
bodies make new ones. Tiny living things try
to make us sick, but our bodies are full of
groups of tiny machines flying all over the

place looking for things that don’t belong
and getting rid of them. Usually, these problems get fixed without us even knowing!
But just as there are places we can’t travel
without help from other people and machines—like the Moon, or the bottom of the

WALL AIR
The walls of normal houses
have power holes and water
holes. The walls in these
buildings have those holes, but
they also have lots of air holes.

BAG OF WATER TO

BAG
HOLDER

These bags are used to put
water and stuff into people.
Sometimes, doctors put
things in bodies by having
people eat them, but these
are used when doctors
need to take a shorter path,
without going through
the food system.

If someone is having trouble
breathing, the doctors will run
a line to their nose or mouth
from one of these holes, and
the wall will help them get
more air into that person.

This makes the water fall
through in the form of drops,
instead of running down in a line.
This makes it easier for doctors
to see how fast it’s moving.

make sure the doctors
know what it’s doing.
These noises happen
a lot, and can make
people worry that
there’s a problem, but
they’re normal.

This machine watches
the person in the bed,
keeping track of how
they’re breathing and
how different parts of
their body are working.
It shows this information
on a screen so doctors
can quickly tell whether
there’s a problem.

A lot of problems

Visiting one of these

and waiting. If
you’re ever stuck in

you can use the wall

lots of these holes
and won’t mind.

the water down it.

CHEST STARTER
If the blood pusher
in your chest stops
working, it has to be
fixed very fast.
This machine
sends power
through it,
which can start
it working again.

When we’re sick, or something goes wrong
with us, sometimes we need to visit a room
full of machines like these so we can talk to
doctors and get the help we need.

PERSON WATCHER

Sometimes, the bags
hold special food to make
people better. Other times,
the bags just give water.
They do that if someone
needs water but might not
be able to drink anything
without feeling sick.

DROPS

sea—there are problems we can’t fix without
help from other people and machines.

These are for
pulling water
and other stuff
out of places in
bodies where
there’s too much
of it (usually
the mouth and
nose). You
probably don’t
want to know
anything more.

ARM TABLE
People can keep a cup of
water here. Doctors will also
bring around food when it’s
time to eat (unless the people
are sick in a way
that means they
can’t eat normal
food right away).

there’s no

WATCHING LINES
These lines run to the computer that
keeps track of what’s happening
in the person’s body and puts
information on the screen above.

SHEETS
It can be cold in these buildings, but doctors will
usually bring sheets and other warm layers to people
who ask for them. They even have a special heated
box where they keep sheets warm for cold people.

WHEELS
ROLLING PROBLEM TABLE
If someone has a new problem show up while they’re in
the room, and there’s no time to move them to a place
where that kind of problem is normally fixed, doctors will
bring one of these rolling problem tables. They’re full of
things for helping with all kinds of problems that need to
be fixed within just a few minutes of when they happen.

These let people
move the bag
holder around.
That way, they
can go to the
bathroom without
having to take out
their hand line.

FOOT
CONTROLS

LEG PRESSERS

Doctors can move
the parts of the
bed using these
foot controls, to
make it lie flat like
a normal bed or
sit up like a chair.

Sometimes, if people have certain
kinds of problems with blood, doctors
will have them wear special pants that
press on their legs. This is to move
blood around, to keep too much of it
from getting stuck somewhere in their
body and causing a problem.

HOLDING BOXES
These are usually full of
extra clothes and sheets
for people who are
visiting, but they can also
be empty, for visitors to
put their stuff in. (If you’re
visiting, you should ask
before using them.)

PLAYING FIELDS
And how big they are.
(The real-life ﬁelds are all ten hundred times larger than these drawings.)
A lot of games are played by throwing things,
kicking things, hitting things, and using sticks.
Games put these together in different ways:
THROWING/
HITTING

STICKS

KICKING

MIDDLE FAR
CATCHER

In this game,
one player
on each team
can throw
the ball.

WALL

STICK BALL

If you hit the ball
over this wall, and
no guards catch
it in the air, they
can’t go get it.

In this game, a player on one team
throws the ball, and a player on the
other team tries to hit it with a stick.
If a player hits the ball, they run along
a path on the field, and try to get as
far as they can before the other team
finds the ball and brings it back to
try to touch the players on the other
team with it. Players who get touched
by the ball, or blocked by someone
holding it, have to stop trying to run
farther along the path and have to
leave the field for a while.

LEFT FAR
CATCHER

CARRYING

CIRCLE BALL
Two teams play this game
with a big yellow-red ball
on a hard floor. Each team
tries to get the ball through
a hanging circle at the other
team’s end of the floor. They
can throw the ball, but not
kick or carry it. If they want
to carry the ball, they have
to keep throwing it at the
ground and catching it when
it comes back up.

END LINE

The players out here
try to get the ball
and then stop the
other team’s players
from running. The
guards stand near
the running path
and try to touch the
runners with the ball.

If you go outside
this line, you get
in trouble.

If you carry the ball over this
line, your team gets points.

touch the ground on their side fewer

FOOT BALL (MY COUNTRY)
In this game, each team tries to get the ball to the other end of the
field. They can carry it, throw it, and sometimes kick it, while other
players try to carry, throw, and sometimes kick them.

If you kick the

not as many as
if you carry the

DOOR

In this game, each team tries to get the ball through a door at the other
end of the field. Most players can’t use their hands, but each team has one
player who guards their door and often uses nothing but hands.

RIGHT FAR
CATCHER

They can use their arms and hands
to hit the ball, but they can’t catch it.

CIRCLE-STICK

WALL

Two players (or teams
of two) stand on either
side of a short wall. Each
player uses a flat stick
with a circle-shaped seethrough wall at the end to
hit the ball back over the
wall to the other side.

SLIDING AROUND
WITH STICKS
Two teams play this game with
sticks, a small plastic rock, and
a field of ice with a door at each
end. The players slide around
very fast hitting the rock with
their sticks, each trying get it
through the other team’s door.

EARTH’S PAST
Everything* that has happened here so far *NOT QUITE EVERYTHING
We learn about the history of the Earth from
rocks. Rocks are laid down in layers, and by
looking at the layers from different parts of
the world, which are all different ages, we
can piece together a single history that goes
back almost to the start of the world.

NOW

This picture shows what it would look like if
you could see the whole history of Earth in a
single set of layers, with every year as thick
as every other. In real life, no single place
has all these layers together, and there are
no layers at all from the oldest part of the
Earth’s history.

All of human history,
since we first learned
to write and build
cities, is a layer as thin
as a piece of paper.

SPACE ROCK HITS EARTH
A big rock hit the Earth, and lots of the animals died. Some
groups lived, like birds, some kinds of fish, and our parents.

THE BIRD TIME
THE TREE
TIME

ICE
AGES

THE BIRD TIME
A big, well-known group of animals lived during this time. Today’s
birds are the only animals from that family alive now, but many
other animals came from it in the past—like big ones with long
necks and bitey ones with huge teeth.

Humans learned to
use words around
this time.

THE GREAT DYING
EVERYTHING GETS COLD
The Earth got really cold here, and ice
covered lots of it, even parts around
the middle where it’s usually hot.

LIFE GETS BIG
AND STRANGE

Almost everything died here, and we’re not
sure why. There were lots of strange changes
in the air and the sea, and around that time
a huge layer of hot rock came up out of the
Earth and covered a large part of the land.
So whatever happened, it was pretty bad.

Around this time, big
animals started to
appear. If you find
rocks from this time,
“The Great Dying” sounds like a name made
you can see lots of
up to use simple words, but it’s not; serious
strange things in them. people call it that.

LAND COMES TOGETHER AND BREAKS UP
THE SIMPLE TIME
For a long time, life was pretty
simple. There were no animals. Most
life was small, either made of single
bags of water moving around alone,
or big groups of bags growing in
big piles on the sea floor.

SPACE ROCK HITS EARTH

SPACE ROCK HITS EARTH

Right now, Earth’s land is broken up into five or six big
areas with water in between, but before that, it was pushed
together. We think this breaking up and pushing together
happened a few times, although it’s hard to tell how many.

THE GREAT AIR CHANGE
Around this time, the air changed. A kind of life appeared
that ate the Sun’s light and breathed out a new kind of air.
This new air probably killed almost everything else, and
for the first time it made fire possible. But it’s also the part
of air we need to breathe, so it was good for us!

The family of
animals we come
from—along with
dogs and cats, but
not birds or fish—
got bigger and
more important
after the space
rock hit.

SPACE ROCK
DEATH

Trees and flowers do the same kind of breathing as that
early life. We think the things in their leaves that let them
eat the Sun’s light—the things which make them green—
are the children of the life that changed the air.

BIRD
TIME

RED METAL LINES
There was once a kind of metal that was spread
out in all the waters of the sea (the same way
the white stuff we put on food is now).
When the air changed, the water changed too.
The metal turned red and fell to the bottom of
the sea. It left beautiful red lines in the rocks.
We use the metal from those layers to make
things like machines and buildings.

THE GREAT ROCK FALL
FIRST SIGNS OF LIFE
The first signs of life appear in
these rocks. We’ve found some
black rocks (the kind used in
writing sticks) that we think must
have come from living things.
But there are very few rocks
from this time, and they’re old
and hard to understand for sure.

Most of the big circles on the Moon seem to be from around this
time, which makes us think there were a lot of rocks flying around
hitting worlds around then.
The rocks might have been thrown at us by the big air worlds far
from the Sun. As they settled into their circle paths—some of them
may have changed places!—their pull would have changed the path
of the rocks around them, and some of those might have hit us.
If the rocks hit the Moon, they probably hit the Earth (and other
worlds near us) too, and might have made the land run like water
and the seas turn to air.

OLDER LIFE?
EARTH FORMED
The Earth formed from the same
cloud that the Sun and other
worlds did, at around the same
time. It was hot when it formed,
but we think it must have cooled
off pretty quickly, because
we’ve seen signs that there was
water almost right away.

MOON FORMED
We think the Earth got
hit by another world
here, while it was
forming, and all the rock
that got thrown free
turned into the Moon.

All life is part of one family, and the information stored in our water bags
changes over time, as animals have children and those children have children.
By looking at the information stored in the water bags of living things,
doctors can figure out how long ago their shared parents lived.
When people have tried to work out how old life’s shared parent is, they
sometimes come up with a number that’s a little older than the great rock fall.
But we think the seas turned to air and the rocks to fire, and it’s hard to
understand how anything could have lived through that.

QUESTION TIME
This picture shows rock layers back to the start of
the Earth, but in real life, there aren’t any big areas
of rock left over from before this time, so it’s hard
to say what it was like. We think there were seas, at
least for part of it, but we’re not sure what it was like.

BIG BRAINS WITH LOTS OF ARMS
(WRITING WATER ANIMALS)

All life (that we know of) is part of a family. We all come from one
living thing that appeared in the early days of the Earth. That living thing grew, had children, and changed over time. People, trees,
grass, and ﬂowers are all children of that ﬁrst life.

STOMACHS WITH HOUSES
FLAT STONES THAT BREATHE WATER

As living things make more living things, the information they pass
to them changes, making the new things a little different from the
old. Over time, these small changes can lead to very different kinds
of living things growing from one. This tree shows how different
kinds of life branched off from one another.

broke into two big

were made of single

were pretty simple.

like each other—it
took us a while to
figure out that they
were from such
different parts of
life’s family tree.

HOW THE THIRD GROUP STARTED
At some point, probably when the Earth was
about half as old as it is now, some of those bags
ate other bags, and the eaten bags started living
inside them.

TINY TREES
CLOTHES

Those new living things, made from the two groups put
together, formed a third group. After a while, the little living
things in that group started sticking together to make bigger
living things. All living things made from more than one bag of
water—like trees, flies, and humans—come from this group.

FOOD OFTEN IN CANS

THE STUFF IN DARK SWEETS
TREES WITH SWEET BLOOD

The other two groups are still around, and in many ways
they’re much bigger than our group. The creatures in those
groups are very small, but there are so many different kinds of
them that no one has come close to counting them all. They
live everywhere, from seas to the air to inside our bodies and
our food. Some of them are even found far below the land’s
surface, where they live by eating rocks and metal. (Until we
found those, we didn’t know living things could do that.)

WHAT THIS TREE IS GOOD FOR
You can use the tree to tell how much one creature is like
another by following their paths. An animal whose path broke
off from ours earlier is different from us in more ways than
one whose path broke off later, like how an aunt or uncle is
different in more ways than a brother or sister.
Sometimes, these families can be a little surprising. Birds and
humans are closer to one another than we are to the fish we
keep in our houses, which makes sense. But those fish are
closer to humans than to the big bitey fish that sometimes eat
people, which is strange!

They lived, grew, and changed for
a very long time. When a space
rock hit Earth, most of the ones that
were alive at that time died out, but
some groups didn’t. We call the branch
that those groups are from “birds.”
Sometimes, you’ll hear people say that birds came
from that family, but that they’re not really part of
it. This is wrong! Just about any way you count it,
birds are part of that family.

This is just a tiny part of the tree of life. The
whole tree is too big to ﬁt in any single picture, and there are too many kinds of life
for anyone to give names to all of them—no
matter what kind of words they use.
And really, a true tree of life wouldn’t just
have a line for every kind of life. It would
have a line for each living thing that ever
was, every one of them crossing and joining
and winding across the page, slowly changing from one kind of life to another, in a path

No one really knows how many living things

some guesses, and they’re big. Not only can
we never ﬁnd enough words to talk about
all those lives, we have a hard time talking
about the number itself.
Here’s one way to think about how many

a beach, pick up some sand and look at it.
Imagine that every tiny piece of sand under
your feet is a whole world of its own, each
one with its own seas and beaches, just like
Earth.
The full tree of life has as many living things
as there are bits of sand on all those beaches
on all those tiny sand worlds put together.
Next to the world we’re talking about, all our
words are small.

THE TEN HUNDRED WORDS
PEOPLE USE THE MOST
This is my set of the ten hundred words
people use the most.

counting all come up with different sets of
words people use the most.

There are lots of different ways of counting how much people use a word. You can
look at what words people use in TV shows,
in books, in news stories, in the letters they
write, or when sending computer messages.
You can also look at words that are most
used right now, or at words that have been
used for the past ten years, or the past hundred. You can look at all books, or books of
made-up stories, books of history, or wellknown old books. These different ways of

I wanted to write this book using words
that sounded familiar and simple. To choose
the set of ten hundred words I would use, I
looked at many sets of words put together
in different ways (I even made one by
counting the words in computer messages
people had sent me). I especially looked at
sets of words made from books that told
made-up stories, since I found that counting how much a word was used in those
books ﬁt well with how “simple” it sounded.

If the different sets agreed that a word was
used a lot, I added it to my ten hundred.
If they didn’t agree on a word, I used my
sense of how simple the word was to decide
whether it should be in the ten hundred.
Here are the words I chose. If you want to
try explaining something using only these
ten hundred words, you can use xkcd.com/
simplewriter to check your words as you
write!

Notes
In this set, I count different word forms—like “talk,” “talking,” and “talked”—as one word. I also allowed most “thing” forms of “doing” words, like “talker”—
especially if, like “goer,” it wasn’t a real word but it sounded funny. In some places, I didn’t use words even when they were allowed. I could have said “ship,”
but I stuck to “boat” because “space boat” makes me laugh. Also, there’s a pair of four-letter words that are very common, but which I left off this page
since some people don’t like to see them. (I didn’t want to use those words anyway.)

HELPERS
A lot of people helped me with this book. Their names
aren’t words that people use a lot, but I’m going to
write them anyway because they’re important.
